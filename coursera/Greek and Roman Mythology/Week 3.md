## Week 3

### 3.1: Odysseus and the Cyclops

Books 9-12: Some of the best parts of the Odyssey

- His hosts still don't know his identity, he is explaining himself now...
- name, lineage, where are you from (answers right at the beginning), his past
  - he goes on to tell his stories with more detail
- Odysseus becomes the bard of the tale
- most important stories come in 3:
  - book 9: Ciconians, the lotus-eaters (Lotophagi), the Cyclops
    - short, short, long
  - book 10: Aeolus, Lastrygonians, Circe
    - short, short, very long
  - book 11: long journey into the underworld
  - book 12: Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, and cattle of the sun
    - short, short, and long
- look for temptation, curiosity and gaining knowledge
  - Odysseus is passionately curious and desires to gain knowledge
- watch out for food crimes of all kinds
  - things are being treated as foods that should not be eaten
- humans will become animals
- Odysseus is searching for knowledge
- when he goes to the underworld, he discovers there is an important secret that explains why things are happening to you. Go to the underworld to find out.
- Heroes don't want to sit back and relax (retire early and play golf)

#### Odysseus and the Cyclops

- features of the Cyclops
  - strange clumping of creatures
  - they are missing a lot of things
    - they don't have cultivation or settled farming technology
    - they don't have wheat or bread so they need to get their nutrition from somewhere else
    - they don't have counsels: they don't form alliances to help each other solve problems
    - no homes, just caves: a huge sign of lack of civilization
    - most remarkable, they don't know how to build ships so they do not meet a lot of different people that are different from them
    - they entirely lack xenia
      - this is a recurring thing
    - they don't understand the guest relationship
      - they asked Polyphemus for a gift and he receives none
    - Odysseus gives the Cyclops his own gift that he received from Meron, subverting him by debilitating him
    - Odysseus and his men receive no gift from the Cyclops so Odysseus gives him a gift to debilitate him
    - the giant, instead of demonstrating xenia and offering his guests food, he uses Odysseus' own men as food (very bad manners)
    - Cyclops is not only ignoring the rules of xenia, he is perverting them
    - **Universal law #3: It is not good to be food.**
      - it is so awful to consider as humans, it is revolting and disgusting
    - reminds us that animals survive by eating other living things
    - we like to think that we are not just part of the food chain
- Odysseus cleverly decides to debilitate rather than kill the giant, since they cannot escape if they killed him
- Another trick of Odysseus, he responds when asked for his name with "Nobody." So when the Cyclops' friends, they think he is fine because he says, "Nobody is hurting me."
- Odysseus then adopts this pure anonymity, the name of no name
  - in some ways, he loses his name with the Cyclops episode
  - not though quite well enough
  - it marks his entry into this new strange world of anonymity
- like great Heroes, he can't stand the fact that the Cyclops might not know who beat him. He then tells him his name, giving Polyphemus the means to call down a terrible curse. Without the name, he would be powerless to do it. He calls upon his dad, Poseidon, to take care of Odysseus (bad mistake Odysseus)
- **Cyclops represents an important lesson on the importance of xenia**
  - he is a perfect example of what not to do
  - Greeks can sit back and listen and dwell upon the proper way of hosting guests (you don't want to act like a Cyclops)

### 3.2 Cycle Two: Circe
