### The Mycenaean Civilization and Dark Ages

#### Video 1 - Mycenaean Civilization (ca. 1500 - 1150 BCE)

- The Minoan civilization has a troubled history
  - Peer Polity model
  - Re-distributive economy
- We will move from the island of Crete to the mainland, to a section called Mycenes
- The Mycenaeans wanted:
  - land that would be easy to defend
  - ample sources of fresh water
    - Mycenes had 2 springs

Mycenae:

- discovered by **Heinrich Schliemann (1822 - 1890)**
  - charismatic archaeologist forever linked with the site of Mycenes
  - made his fortune being an international businessman
  - knew a swath of languages
  - in middle age, he desired to become an archaeologist
  - he wanted to discover what Homeric reality would have been like
    - he wanted to discover the sites that would have been in the Illiad and the Odyssey
  - he first went to Troy
    - he found an enormous amount of treasure, King Priam's treasure
    - his wife wore some of the treasure
    - this was a spectacular hit
    - he became an international celebrity
  - then, he went to the ancient Bronze Age site of Mycenae
    - went to one of the great walls, the Lion's Gate, an entrance to one of these sites
    - allegedly, Schliemann said he was guided by the voice of Homer
    - the Lion's Gate was clearly built for defense
      - the stones are so large they are known as cyclopian since they were so large only a cyclops could lift and construct them
    - as he began his excavation of Mycenae, he discovered a grave circle
      - a number of distinct features
        - a number of upright tablets with writings and images
        - they were meant to mark graves
        - they were thought of as the boundary between the living and the dead
        - the people buried there left behind enormous quantities of gold, but no name
        - "The Mask of Agamemnon"
          - one of the gold masks that were placed on people who were buried
          - some people think Schliemann created and placed it. Our professor, Andrew Szegedy-Maszak, is not so convinced.
            - one scholar thinks it was discovered and cleaned up, or according to Arthur Evans, it was "reconstituted"
            - Schliemann's reputation to some people was between sketchy and nefarious
    - vast amounts of treasure and gold were buried with people
      - very important role in trade
      - personal adornments
    - Greece, at this time, was a very much part of a network of east Aegean economies
      - it didn't look that different from places in the Middle East:
        - agricultural foundation
        - ruling elite
        - production of luxury goods that circulated among the ruling class, no matter where they lived in Greece or elsewhere
    - some time after the cyst graves, circles, the Mycenaeans constructed those enormous cyclopian walls and also began to treat their dead differently than before
      - They buried their dead in massive tombs, Tholos Tombs:
        - they are built into the side of a hill
        - have a long hallway (about 115 feet long for The Treasury of Atreus)
        - the interior has a beehive-shaped dome, some 38 feet high
        - it is estimated that the single piece of stone above the doorway weighs over 100 tons
          - massive amount of anonymous, conscripted labor
        - every time it seems that a burial was performed here, they had to dig out the tunnel from the previous burial
      - Tholos Tomb: "The Treasury of Atreus"
    - the picture we get of the social pyramid is a warrior-elite ruling class
      - they engaged in rivalry with other elites nearby
      - some kind of international trade with their class elsewhere
      - supported technology of gold and of literacy
        - like the Minoans, the Mycenaeans were literate
        - in the Proto-Greek that we call Linear B, here is a Mycenaean Linear B tablet
          - it is one of the little ironies that the flames that engulfed the Mycenaean citadels baked the tablets that were not meant to be preserved for a long time, they were temporary notations of store house contents
      - we also get pictures of social unrest or at least of high military preparedness
        - one of the most well-preserved artifacts is one of the bore-tusked helmets that Homer talked about soldiers having to protect their heads
- **Mycenae civilization underwent a sudden, massive, systemic collapse.** Between 1100 and 1150 BCE, in one citadel site after another, we find evidence of burning, pillaging, and destruction.
  - the inhabitants were killed or dispersed
  - their homes left for scavenging



Mycenaean history and artifacts show they were much more violent than the Minoans.

#### Video 2 - The Dark Ages (ca. 1150 - 800 BCE)

Mycenaean civilization collapsed rapidly and systemically.

Who did it? What caused this collapse?

- There are a number of possibilities scholars consider that caused this:
  - drought
  - internal revolt, seems less likely as there wasn't a uniform proletariat
  - economic disruption
    - around 1200 BCE, is a time of tremendous stress
    - the arrival of the "sea people" that clearly were making trouble
    - would have taken the form of a break in those systems of trade among the elite.
      - some scholars say the economy was so fragile, that when they were disrupted, it collapsed
  - invasion
    - invaders tend to only leave traces of their destruction
    - there used to be a theory called the "Dorian Invasion"
      - that people swept in from the North, wrecked the Mycenaean sites
      - based largely on one passage in the historian Lucidedes
      - only has one big problem: there is no evidence
      - **it has been abandoned**
- We can be certain of one thing: **the collapse happened**

Why did it last so long?

- it stays dark for around 300 years
- one explanation:
  - terracing on the sides of steep mountains for agriculture of olives
    - required enormous amount of labor
    - would have been near impossible to do the agriculture necessary for the culture
- another explanation: societal and control of fertility
  - What was life like back then?
    - small groups moving from place to place
    - relatively small populations are actually beneficial
      - help with survival: fewer mouths to feed
    - control of female fertility by waiting for girls to become older before becoming married and having children

The effects were devastating:

- tremendous decline in population:
  - fewer grave sites, fewer a much farther between
- there is no evidence of gold in burials: it stops
  - no support for this anymore
  - the craftsmen that had been working for the elite, did not have anyone to work for anyone anymore
- international trade stopped
  - used to be that Mycenaean artifacts could be found around the Eastern Mediterranean, but it stopped
  - not even much pottery is found
  - those trade networks disintegrated
- Surprisingly, literacy also goes missing
  - The Mycenaean "Linear B", a fairly clumsy form with 87 characters and awhile to memorize, had been used exclusively to record the contents of the store houses and warehouses of the citadels
    - when they were emptied, the technology to record their contents vanished
      - it had been restricted to a very small number of scribes and they simply had no one to work for anymore

What was life like after this?

- it continued, certainly
- small groups living somewhat a semi-nomadic existence
  - staying in a place just long enough to grow a few crops, for one or two planting seasons and moving on
- subsistence agriculture and life in the ruins
- it is not to say that activity stopped completely
- around 1000 BCE, Greeks start to shift population from the mainland to across the islands, to the coast of Asia Minor, Ionia, (modern day Turkey)

- Dorian invasion, no evidence, came from the north (Albania and farther north) and pushed Greeks to the western coast of Turkey
- moving from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age
- another possible reason is technology: iron
- massive burial ground discovered on peninsula west of Athens
  - within, two burial pits
    - male, with iron spear
    - female with lavish gold ornamentation
    - the other pit had 4 horses with bronze in their mouths
  - it was a tomb
  - suggested it was a hero shrine
  - nothing like this anywhere throughout the area of Greece
- also, a little artifact of a centaur
