# Chapter 2: Fundamental Elements in the Problem of Analysis. Quantitative and Qualitative Factors

## Four Fundamental Elements

1. The security
2. The price
3. The time
4. The person

Should security *S* be bought (or sold, or retained) at price *P*, at this time *T*, by individual *I*?

#### The Personal Element

#### The Time

The time at which an issue is analyzed may affect the conclusion in various ways.

Securities are selected by the application of standards of quality and yield, and both of these -- particularly the latter -- will **vary with financial conditions in general**.

**Security analysis, as a study, must necessarily concern itself as much as possible with principles and methods which are valid at all times -- or, at least, under all ordinary conditions.**

#### The Price

#### The Security: Character of the Enterprise and the Terms of the Commitment

##### Example of Commitment on Unattractive Terms

Prior to 1929 the value of urban real estate had tended to grow steadily over a long period of years; hence it came to be regarded by many as the "safest" medium of investment. But the purchase of a preferred stock in a New York City real estate development in 1929 might have involved *terms* of investment so thoroughly disadvantageous as to banish all elements of soundness from the proposition.

#### Relative Importance of the Terms of the Commitment and the Character of the Enterprise

Is it better to invest in an attractive enterprise on unattractive terms or in an unattractive enterprise on attractive terms?

The popular view unhesitatingly prefers the **former alternative**, and in so doing it is **instinctively**, rather than logically, right.

Over a long period, experience will undoubtedly show that less money has been lost by the great body of investors through paying too high a price for securities of the best regarded enterprises than by trying to secure a larger income or profit from commitments in enterprises of lower grade.

But, needless to say, this is not a rule to guide the expert merchandise buyer, for he is expected to judge quality by examination and not solely by reputation, and at times he **may even sacrifice certain definite degrees of quality if that which he obtains is adequate for his purpose and attractive in price.**

- this distinction applies as well to the purchase of securities as to buying paints or watches

It results in two principles of quite opposite character, the one suitable for the untrained investor, the other useful only to the analyst.

**1. Principle for the untrained security buyer: *Do not put money in a low-grade enterprise on any terms.***

2. **<u>Principle for the securities analyst: *Nearly every issue might conceivably be cheap in one price range and dear in another.*</u>**

It is natural and proper to prefer a business which is large and well managed, has a good record, and is expected to show increasing earnings in the future.

But these expectation, though seemingly well-founded, often fail to be realized. **Many of the leading enterprises of yesterday are today far back in the ranks. Tomorrow is likely to tell a similar story.**

## Qualitative and Quantitative Factors in Analysis

Analyzing a security involves an analysis of the business.

A buyer of a $1,000 bond would not deem it worth his while to make as thorough an analysis of an issue as would a large insurance company considering the purchase of a $500,000 block.

#### Technique and Extent of Analysis Should Be Limited by Character and Purposes of the Commitment

#### Value of Data Varies with Type of Enterprises

**<u>Most important of all, the analyst must recognize that the value of a particular kind of data varies greatly with the type of enterprise which is being studied</u>.**

#### Quantitative vs. Qualitative Elements in Analysis

Elements under analysis can be formed into two groups:

**Quantitative**:

- statistical exhibit
  - income account and balance sheet
  - production and unit prices, costs, capacity, unfilled orders, etc.
- subheadings:
  - **capitalization**
  - **earnings and dividends**
  - **assets and liabilities**
  - **operating statistics**

**Qualitative**:

- deal with matters related to the nature of the business:
  - relative position of the individual company in the industry
  - its physical, geographical, and operating characteristics
  - the character of the management
  - the outlook for the unit, for the industry, and for business in general

- not dealt with ordinarily in companys' reports

#### Qualitative Factors: Nature of the Business and Its Future Prospects

Qualitative factors upon which most stress is laid: **nature of the business** and the **character of the management**

Industries especially favored by a developing demand may become demoralized through a still more rapid growth of supply.

- has been true for radio, aviation, electric refrigeration, bus transportation, and silk hosiery

#### The Factor of Management

It is not as easy as it sounds to select a "good industry."

**The most convincing proof of capable management lies in a superior comparative record over a period of time.**

- this brings us back to quantitative data

#### The Trend of Future Earnings

A record of increasing profits is a favorable sign.

It is unwise to project past earnings trends into the future.

Security analysis does not assume that a past average will be repeated, but only that it supplies a *rough index* to what may be expected of the future.

**A trend, however, cannot be used as a rough index.**

#### <u>Trend Essentially a Qualitative Factor</u>

#### Qualitative Factors Resist Even Reasonably Accurate Appraisal

**<u>Needless to say, the analyst must take possible future changes into account, but his primary aim is not so much to *profit* from them as to *guard against* them.</u>**

#### Inherent Stability a Major Qualitative Factor
