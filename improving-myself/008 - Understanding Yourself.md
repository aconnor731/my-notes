# Understanding Yourself

To learn to empathize with others, you first need to learn to empathize with yourself.

This is important, and incredibly practical.

Learning to empathize with yourself means learning to **understand and accept what you're feeling and why you're feeling it.**

Sometimes, we get this idea that we need to act happy all the time, or that our problems are not as important as the problems of others, so we feel selfish when we are sad or upset.

But **that's not true.** Your problems matter, because you matter.

Don't keep emotions bottled up.

#### Accepting Your Emotions

You don't have to stay sad.

If you feel it seems like you are sad or angry all the time, you should think seriously about seeing a counselor.

Just like a doctor can help you heal physically, **a counselor can help you heal emotionally**.

On a fundamental level, you should accept that your emotions are a part of you, and **just as you need to accept yourself, you need to accept your emotions.**

#### Understanding Your Emotions

Do you understand the cause of your emotions when you feel something?

Do you give yourself permission to feel an emotion?

Do you accept that it's ok to feel the way you do?

Do you have a healthy way to express those emotions?

If the answer to any of those questions is "No" or "I'm not sure", then take some time to think through how you experience emotions.

It might take some time to process through this, but **it's worth the investment.**

If you understand what it's like when you feel an emotion, you'll be better able to understand and interact with a person who is feeling something similar.

**Even if you don't want to understand your emotions for your own sake, do it for the sake of your relationships with others.**

#### Thinking It Through

Keep an eye on your emotions throughout the day and look at the times in which you are feeling something. Then, take the time to **think through why you're feeling that way.**

Perhaps write down your thoughts on your emotions for the day, and then compare your notes from different days to look for trends.
