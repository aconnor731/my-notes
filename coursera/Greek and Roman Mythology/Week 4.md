### 4.1 Odysseus Meets the Suitors

- Odysseus begins making his way to the center of his town
- Telemachus has learned what it means to be a **purposeful and slightly angry man**
- He starts guaranteeing things said in his own house from others
- Telemachus lies to Eumaeus, like his father
- He instructs Eumaeus to take the stranger, Odysseus, to beg from the suitors, putting him in position
- He now takes responsibility, not faulting the gods
  - He says, "I will see to it, I and the deathless gods"
- Telemachus guarantees the oaths the suitors had taken over the deal made over the fight between the stranger, Odysseus, and the other beggar, Irus
- Telemachus, "The boy you knew is gone."
  - taking responsibility not only for himself, but others' too
- He makes threats that the other suitors are not respecting
- The suitors, hypocritically, try to send out the beggar (Odysseus), when they themselves are eating out his own household
  - they are perverting xenia
  - even the lowly ones deserve xenia
  - all guest-friends come from Zeus
- Eumaeus is doing the right thing and the suitors are not when it comes to xenia
- It is not just that they are being rude to someone, they are violating something that is sacred to the Greeks
  - committing a crime against Zeus
  - "Gods arrive disguised in any way"
- Eumaeus acts a messenger between the stranger (Odysseus) and Penelope
  - Odysseus responds with, "not yet, let's wait until nighttime"
  - Odysseus doesn't respond how most would expect by dropping everything to see the queen

### 4.2 Signs as a Way of Knowing

- the story starts to move by means of secret codes and secret languages
- messages were built into the world around us, according to antiquity
- gods would send messages through dreams, birds, lightning, thunder
  - not thought to be strange coincidences but signs from the gods
- the suitors do not see the signs that the beggar, Odysseus, is not who they think he is
  - his body is much more impressive
- a sneeze marks a sign from the gods that whatever was said is indeed true
  - Homer says that the sneeze of Telemachus is like a thunder clap
- Odysseus is becoming a kind-of seer now to the suitors, although they are oblivious
- birds are being talked about
- Telyclyminous talks about prophecies due to signs
- Odysseus' inner circle are reading these signs, the suitors are not
