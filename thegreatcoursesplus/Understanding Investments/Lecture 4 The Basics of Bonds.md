# Lecture 4: The Basics of Bonds

- Not as sexy as stocks
- Bonds enable governments to borrow, and also for the Fed to expand or shrink the money supply

- issuers of the bond receive cash from borrowing the buyer of the bonds

**Restrictive covenants**: a large set of terms and conditions to help the issuer to lose their money through default

- significantly reduce the risk of loss for the investors

### Bond differences

- Issuer
  - Governments (largest share of the bond markets)
    - safest since governments can raise taxes to pay for them
    - called Municipal bonds (munis), local government units
    - Sovereign bonds, Sovereign debt: foreign governments
    - U.S. government bonds: Treasuries
    - British government bonds: Gilts (named for when back in the day they had gold leaf on the edges)
      - Pounds
    - German government bonds: Bunds
      - Euros
    - Yankee bonds: bonds issued in U.S. dollars in a foreign government
    - IFI: International Financial Institution
      - bonds are treated like foreign government bonds
  - Companies
    - **Corporate bonds is synonymous with private debt**
      - risk of default is a major concern
  - Individuals
    - David Bowie issued bonds and were payed out on the royalties of his previous music
- Secured
  - a bond is secured if it is backed up by specific collateral, which can be claimed upon default or insolvency
  - if insecure, the painstaking process of divvying up who gets what
- Timing of Payments
  - **Maturity**: the length of time until the final payment on the bond
    - 1 day, to 30 years
    - typically 20-30 years
    - also 100 years, called century debt
    - **Bills or Money Market Instruments**: less than 1 year
      - T. Bills
      - 3 month T. Bill: 3 month government bond
    - **Note**: 1 to 10 years
      - Medium-term note: 1-5 years to maturity
    - **Bond**: 10 years or more
  - **Zero-coupon bonds**: single payment, no interest payments (coupons) between the time you buy the bond and the time the borrower makes the payment to you
    - downside: have to wait until the maturity of the bond to receive the interest
    - upside: the price you pay for them is much lower than the price you receive at maturity
    - very similar to Certificates of Deposits (CDs)
  - Most bonds make multiple payments to their holders between their purchase date and its maturity
  - Generally, bonds make regular payments but also is what the parties agree on
    - payments may be of the same size or the size may vary
  - **Coupon payment**: interest only payment, unequal payments because at maturity the borrower will have to make a big payment to repay the principal payment of the loan
  - **Amortizing bonds**: equal payments (don't have to), include both interest and repayment of principle

**Bonds are a much safer investment than stocks**

On the secondary market, the bond maturity time periods reflects the remaining maturity.

**Standard bond or Straight bond**: Borrower (Bond Issuer) pays interest on the principle every 6 months and pays back the principle upon maturity.

Buy-and-hold investment strategy as opposed to active trading investment strategy

Bonds are mostly a dealer market.

Most brokers have access to secondary markets that have corporate, municipal, and government bonds.

**TreasuryDirect**: Enables you to purchase U.S. Treasury as well as savings bonds

Corporations do the same thing, you have to look for them.

Most corporate bonds have large lot sizes on the size of $10,000 and increments of that amount.

U.S Treasury bonds on the other hand are available in small lot sizes on the scale of $1,000.

Some corporate retail bond have $100 with a minimum of \$10,000.

To get the most attractive interest rates, you have to invest 10's of thousands of dollars.

If you have a bond that matures in 20 years, you will not get back the principle for 20 years, but will receive the interest payments.

**Laddering**: use the cash from a matured bond to purchase another bond.

- U.S. Treasury bonds:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
  - 5
  - 7
  - 10
- Secondary Market
  - 4
  - 6
  - 8
  - 9

Reinvestment risk is more of annoyance.

Bonds are called **Fixed-income securities** from economists.

- this does not adjust for inflation
- bond laddering helps mitigate this

A 5 year bond ladder is less at risk to inflation than a 10 year.

The likelihood of default on corporate bonds is at a huge risk during periods of deflation (recessions, depression)

Every so often, local governments default on their bonds.
