## A Field Guide to Comfort

If someone is truly comfortable, they will send multiple "Comfort" body language signals.

#### Key Comfort Signals

- **Leaning In, Moving Closer, or Turning to Face You**

"If someone FEELS close to me, they want to BE close to me."

Feet are a subtle indicator. Most people aren't consciously aware of what their feet are doing.

- **A Tilted Head or a Head Rested on a Hand**

A tilted head indicates curiosity, whereas resting their head on their hand implies that they're listening intently.

- **One Leg Tucked Underneath On a Couch (Girls Only)**

This is a girl-only signal, but a very powerful one. If a girl is sitting next to someone she feels comfortable with, she will often tuck one leg underneath her and turn towards that person. If you are on the receiving end of this, count yourself lucky. It means the girl really enjoys being with you.

- **"I'm Digging This" Smile**

When people are enjoying themselves, often the corners of their mouth will be turned up slightly. It's subtle, but I call this the "I'm digging this" smile--it shows that people are enjoying whatever is going on. If you're telling a funny story to your friends and you notice this smile, that's a good sign.

- **Physical Touch**

This is a significant indicator of comfort.

If they aren't, it is not a big deal. They may not be a touchy person.
