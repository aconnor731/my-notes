# How to Speak How to Listen Notes

Imparting information to an audience that desires the information in question involves neither logical nor rhetorical skill.

One need only speak at a tempo and in a voice that enables the items of information to be heard clearly and distinctly.

The speaker should be able to make a fairly shrewd guess concerning the general character of the views about the subject chosen that are likely to be prevalent among the listeners.

**To persuade listeners to change their minds by adopting views contrary to ones they have persistently and, perhaps, obstinately held, it is necessary to undermine their prejudices in a manner that is as firm as it is gentle.**

Long-standing prejudices are barriers to persuasion. They must be removed before positive persuasion can begin.

**My listeners may harbor prejudices or suspicions about myself that I must overcome before positive persuasion can begin.**

It is important to portray my *ethos* in a favorable light.

I must establish my authority to speak on the subject chosen, if my character and competence has not been conveyed to my audience.

I must also incorporate the *pathos* of the subject.

I should try to arouse emotional responses in my listeners **that are favorable to the course of action I wish them to take**--not only arouse them, but get them flowing steadily in the direction of the action you wish them to engage in.

**The control of *pathos* operates differently in instructive speech that has a <u>theoretical</u>, not a <u>practical</u>, aim.**

I must bring my own emotions, first of all, into play.

I must manifest, as plainly as possible, your own emotional attachment to the views I am presenting.
