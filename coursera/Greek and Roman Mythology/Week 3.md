# Greek and Roman Mythology

## Week 3

### 3.1: Odysseus and the Cyclops

Books 9-12: Some of the best parts of the Odyssey

- His hosts still don't know his identity, he is explaining himself now...
- name, lineage, where are you from (answers right at the beginning), his past
  - he goes on to tell his stories with more detail
- Odysseus becomes the bard of the tale
- most important stories come in 3:
  - book 9: Ciconians, the lotus-eaters (Lotophagi), the Cyclops
    - short, short, long
  - book 10: Aeolus, Lastrygonians, Circe
    - short, short, very long
  - book 11: long journey into the underworld
  - book 12: Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, and cattle of the sun
    - short, short, and long
- look for temptation, curiosity and gaining knowledge
  - Odysseus is passionately curious and desires to gain knowledge
- watch out for food crimes of all kinds
  - things are being treated as foods that should not be eaten
- humans will become animals
- Odysseus is searching for knowledge
- when he goes to the underworld, he discovers there is an important secret that explains why things are happening to you. Go to the underworld to find out.
- Heroes don't want to sit back and relax (retire early and play golf)

#### Odysseus and the Cyclops

- features of the Cyclops
  - strange clumping of creatures
  - they are missing a lot of things
    - they don't have cultivation or settled farming technology
    - they don't have wheat or bread so they need to get their nutrition from somewhere else
    - they don't have counsels: they don't form alliances to help each other solve problems
    - no homes, just caves: a huge sign of lack of civilization
    - most remarkable, they don't know how to build ships so they do not meet a lot of different people that are different from them
    - they entirely lack xenia
      - this is a recurring thing
    - they don't understand the guest relationship
      - they asked Polyphemus for a gift and he receives none
    - Odysseus gives the Cyclops his own gift that he received from Meron, subverting him by debilitating him
    - Odysseus and his men receive no gift from the Cyclops so Odysseus gives him a gift to debilitate him
    - the giant, instead of demonstrating xenia and offering his guests food, he uses Odysseus' own men as food (very bad manners)
    - Cyclops is not only ignoring the rules of xenia, he is perverting them
    - **Universal law #3: It is not good to be food.**
      - it is so awful to consider as humans, it is revolting and disgusting
    - reminds us that animals survive by eating other living things
    - we like to think that we are not just part of the food chain
- Odysseus cleverly decides to debilitate rather than kill the giant, since they cannot escape if they killed him
- Another trick of Odysseus, he responds when asked for his name with "Nobody." So when the Cyclops' friends, they think he is fine because he says, "Nobody is hurting me."
- Odysseus then adopts this pure anonymity, the name of no name
  - in some ways, he loses his name with the Cyclops episode
  - not though quite well enough
  - it marks his entry into this new strange world of anonymity
- like great Heroes, he can't stand the fact that the Cyclops might not know who beat him. He then tells him his name, giving Polyphemus the means to call down a terrible curse. Without the name, he would be powerless to do it. He calls upon his dad, Poseidon, to take care of Odysseus (bad mistake Odysseus)
- **Cyclops represents an important lesson on the importance of xenia**
  - he is a perfect example of what not to do
  - Greeks can sit back and listen and dwell upon the proper way of hosting guests (you don't want to act like a Cyclops)

### 3.2 Cycle Two: Circe

- King Aeolus, has a bag of wind
  - his six sons and daughters are married to each other
- Circe turns Odysseus' men into pigs
  - it is awful to have our humanity taken away from them
  - they are also in the standard repertoire of the food chain
- Men who made this myth fear that a woman can turn a man into a pig, unman a man, strip away his courage.
- Another example of the recurring theme of dangerous women with magical power/aura.
- Circe is overjoyed that Odysseus overpowers her. A year-long tryst occurs and he doesn't want to leave. His men had to convince him to leave.
- Before leaving, Circe gives him secret knowledge that is in the underworld.
- She instructs him how to bait the dead with a combination of libations so he can interview them to find his way to find his way to Tigerious
- they don't even know that one of their crew mates has drank too much, fell, and died
  - this will be important for the future

### 3.3: The Underworld

- the underworld is not under anything, it is far away
- it is so far away, it is not like Dante's so far down
- sulfurous
- these shades need blood as life would return to them, re-embodied, allowing them to speak
- the Greeks would much rather be alive than dead
- ethical scores are not settled in the underworld, they are not being judged, they are floating around, a place you don't want to be (like being on a layover in an airport)
- Tantalus and Sisyphus are the exceptions as they are being eternally punished
- Elpenor tells Odysseus he must bury him, Homer is legitimizing the importance of burial for the dead
- Tiresias is Apollo's priest, has deep wisdom for both the future, present, and past
- Tiresias tells him he must apologize to Poseidon
- Odysseus must take an oar so far inland so people do not recognize it and then build a temple to Poseidon
- Remember, Odysseus is telling this story to Alcinous so when Alcinous suddenly chimes in, it is logically sound
- Agamemnon's son Orestes corrects things by murdering his father's murderer
- The killing of Achilles does not happen in the Illiad, Homer explains it here
- Achilles tells Odysseus he would rather be a slave and still alive than be the grand person that I am and be locked down in here with the dead

### 3.4 Cycle 3: The Cattle of the Sun

- Odysseus passes the Sirens after leaving from the house of Circe
- The Sirens claim to know everything
- They are singing to him everything and he is a man who is always seeking knowledge
- He figured out how to hear it all while remaining alive
- Odysseus passes through the realm of the Scylla and Carybdis
- He knows he will lose some men near the Scylla, but he will lose all men if he chooses risking Carybdis
- **Universal Law #4: Usually making leadership decisions means choosing between two bad things**
- He loses some men by choosing to go near Scylla
- Cattle are the most luscious and the most appropriate kind of gift that is grand enough to give a gift to the Gods. They also sacrifice goats, pig, chicken, but not fish weirdly.
- Most of the time, the Gods want the smoke from the sacrifice
- The Gods love cow meat
- The Greeks were almost obsessed with cattle and were always trying to find more of them
- Bulls are central in pieces of art about ancient Greek
- Cattle have overwhelming levels of protein, the most expensive, only the most wealthy aristocrats could afford cattle
- Large area of land was required to raise cattle to graze and slaughter
- Helios has declared these cattle are sacred to them. So they are no longer an authorized food source. So when they slaughter and eat them, they are violating something that was told to them not to eat by a religious authority, an indelible law.

### 3.5: Food/Not Food

#### Food Crimes and Xenia

- Homer says, "Oh my gosh! I can't believe they ate Helios' Cattle of the Sun!"
- The line between food and not food is **culturally defined**
- It is the basic way we associate with people. Do they eat the same kind of food as I/we do?
- The disgust response is non-negotiable.
  - You can't just talk them out of it.
- You and I do NOT count as food. It is almost universally true. It is absolutely the case of the Greeks.
- When humans become part of the food chain, it is considered a Food Crime.
- Eating something the Gods' have instructed never to eat and metabolize the thing they ate, they are punished severely.

### 3.6 Structuralism

- Remember, we would use Functionalism as a tool
- Another tool: Structuralism
- Came from Claude Levi-Strauss (1908-2009)
  - very important in anthropology, sociology, and the study of myth
- human culture is a product of the human mind
- our brain's work as a mode of binaries: yes/no, black/white
  - abstraction layers are functions of binaries: grey is a combination of black and white
- the core binary moment: sometimes there is Mommy, sometimes there is no Mommy

#### Structuralism and Myth

- no matter the nuance, the stories will have some binary opposition that is driving them forward
- books 9-12, food/not food, a structuralist reading
- a structuralist will not be interested in the temporal, diachronic nature of the story
- they are interested in the pieces, the atomic pieces:
  - which of these is a representation of one side of a binary, which are the other
  - which parts of the narrative represent one theme, which parts represent the opposite theme
- structuralists are not looking at the change of cultures he encounters: they will look at how they are similar or different
  - the relationship among the items is the most important aspect of the story
-
