# Week 8

## 8.1: Introduction to Oedipus

- Eurypedes, Sophocles, and Aeschylus make up the three greats of ancient Athens
- Sophocles: Oedipus
- What makes up a Greek identity? Remember from the Odyssey with Odysseus.
  - he has to recover his name, his background, and where he is from
- Sophocles inverts all of this, turns it upside down
- p. 258 of the Odyssey, matches the story of Oedipus
  - son kills the father, mother marries the son, mother commits suicide
  - Oedipus is born from this
  - Homer doesn't go into depth
- Sophocles remakes this in a powerful way
- Oedipus is trying to figure out the identity of the murderer, also causing him to ask himself the same question
- Oedipus ripping out his own eyes and his mothers' suicide happen behind the door

## 8.2: Oedipus and Fate

- lots of riddles
- message is trying to be sent but is being sent in an oblique manner
- life doesn't always reveal its messages clearly
- good with the Sphinx' riddle but not other riddles in his life
- Oedipus turns a blind eye to what is to come, ending up blinding himself horrificly
- Oedipus' dislocation is tragic
- site at Delphi will show up in important ways
- it knows everything that is going to happen to him and is continuous throughout his life
- Oedipus should be humble at Delphi and he is anything but
- important theme: **fate**
- Is he to blame for what he endures or is it fate?
- It seems he does not bear any responsibility.
- He hears from the oracle early on that he will kill his father and marry his mother, and he immediately runs away
- He is intelligent for solving the Sphinx' riddle, and receives wealth, notoriety, and acclaim.
- As he is diligently staying away from what the oracle said would happen, he marries someone who is relatively the same age as his mother, and he kills someone of his father's age.
- He kills him by playing chicken on an ancient Roman highway
- Oedipus gets bonked on the head after the collision, and then murders everyone there. He is a little off.
- He is a very intelligent person. But the question of judgment is slightly different.
- These little suspicions around the people of the older generation...
- He repeatedly conditions his own life and success on the Delphic oracle being wrong, very sacrilegious.

## 8.3: Oedipus and Oracles

- he is a great solver of riddles, let's look at this in more depth
- however, he struggles with the messages coming back from Delphi
- he pays a terrible price for not being able to understand these messages
- Teiresias is Apollo's priest, and Oedipus is wrong for not listening to him
- Teiresias, doesn't want to tell him directly, but eventually gets boxed in and then says to Oedipus, "You are the pollution. You murdered the guy."
- Oedipus starts accusing nasty things upon Teiresias after this.
- Creon asks Oedipus, "Suppose you do not understand..."
  - Oedipus is incapable of confronting when he is either wrong or cannot find what is right.
- Oedipus realizes that he is the own to murder the King at the crossroads. He says here:
  - "A wandering of the soul I could run mad."
  - What the oracle has said is true.
- Oedipus wants the herdsman to confirm the lie that thieves killed the King.
- the herdsman is revealed to be the man who Oedipus was given to by the Corinthian and was raised by him
- the Corinthian herdsman reveals to Oedipus that he was given to him and was adopted
- then, Oedipus realizes he is the murderer of his own father, Lias, and has married his own mother
- he rips out his eyes and his mother commits suicide
- we are all left with limits with our knowledge. Now, Oedipus is forced to live with his limits as he refused to do so in the past.
