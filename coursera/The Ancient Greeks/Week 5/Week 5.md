## Week 5 / Lecture 1: The Aftermath of the Persian Wars - The Delian League

- we have seen how the Greek states came together to defeat the Persians
- 3 main outcomes of the war:
  - Persians were utterly defeated
  - there was a sense of Greek unity, briefly
    - a monument still stands in Istanbul, Turkey, on it, it says:
      "These fought the war: the Lacedaimonians. The Athenians. The Corinthians. The Tegeans. The Sicyonians. The Aeginetans...(and 25 more Poleis)"
- Greeks called any non-Greeks barbarians
  - main factor was that they didn't speak Greek
- Athens and Sparta come out as the two hegemonic, dominant polis in this group
- two heroes of the Persian Wars: Pausanias and Themistocles
- both had a checkered past
- Themistocles, an Athenian:
  - Sparta proposed not rebuilding the wall around north of the Pelopennese
  - Athens was not too excited about that
  - Themistocles stalled the Spartans while they completed the wall
  - **he had enormous power and prestige**
    - this caused political antagonism
  - his political enemies finally did get him ostracized in 471-470, 9 years after his victories in the Persian War
  - then, he went to Persia to be a Greek advisor
- **So many of the leaders suffered similar fates**
- so on Delos, Apollo and Artemis reigned. It is sacred because myth says Leto gave birth to them here.
- a league was formed that would meet at Delos, due to its sacred nature
  - each of the states, member states, was guaranteed autonomy
  - annual contribution could be money or ships
  - they had in effect established for themselves the mechanism, or the prelude to Athenian domination
- no longer was this the old war of Hoplites, those middling men, those citizen soldiers, who provided themselves their own armor. Instead, now we have warfare, year-round.
  - the Navy was kept on constant patrol
    - to keep Persians away
    - to collect contributions, whcih came to be called tribute
    - the Athenian sailors received state pay
    - **economically, the Navy is very costly**. It requires constant cash flow.

## Week 5 / Lecture 2: From Delian League to Athenian Empire

- Athens was proposed to lead this new confederation
- main goals:
  - protect against Persia
  - collect contributions
  - equality for states, but Athens comes first
- Athens had a lot of free labor, not slave labor, which gave them an enormous advantage over the other states
- the year-round presence of the fleet was a new way of warfare
- all of the states are either islanders or on the coast
- Athens dominated because of their fleet and the fact that the other states were on the coast and as islands
- the chronology of history of the following decades is difficult, we use Thucydides' Book 1 and other inscriptions
- Chimon, a successful general, takes a fleet to Eurymidon, a place on the southern border in Turkey (not shown in map), because it was rumored the Persians were amassing another fleet
- Naxos announces they will leave the league, Athens says no and surrounds them
- their contributions change from ships to cash
- around 465, the Athenians get into a quarrel with the island of Thasos, up north in the Aegean Sea, over gold mines on the northern coast of the mainland near Thasos
- Thasos appeals to Sparta for help
- Spartans must have observed the growing power of Athens with alarm
- around 464, a huge earthquake hit Sparta and the **Helots rebelled, the native Nycenians who had been forced into state serfhood**
  - remember, they were kept in constant state terrorism
  - they used the disruption of the earthquake to mount a rebellion
- a sign of how serious this was to Sparta, they asked Athens to help them, just after the Spartans told Thasos they would help defend against Athens
- in Athens, Cimon was the leader of the pro-Spartan party, son of Miltiades, the victor at Marathon
  - he persuaded his fellow Athenians to help Sparta by saying they were the two main states that fended off the Persians
- Cimon goes down to Sparta with 4,000 hoplites, but upon arrival, Sparta sent them home
- we aren't too sure why they did this
- Cimon's pro-Spartan policy is discredited
- in 462, Pericles, working with a political ally named Ephialtes, engineered a reform
- in the following year, in 461, Cimon was ostracized
  - the leader of what one might think of as a sort of moderate democratic or pro-Spartan faction was removed from the political scene
- we will begin to see now the continuing transformation of this voluntary confederacy of independent polis into a network of ostensibly free but in fact Athenian-dominated tribute paying allies.
- **one of the great sources of information we have is a magnificent set of inscriptions called the <u>Athenian Tribute Lists</u>**
- in the 450s, the Athenians decided to move the treasury of the Delian League to Athens for "safe-keeping"
- Athenians began keeping meticulous record of how much each state paid every year
- 1 60<sup>th</sup> of the tribute went to Athena
- these allow us to track internal relations in the league
- Athens controlled the allies with their Naval fleet
- Athenians tended to support democratic factions in states where there was political struggle
- they also controlled trade with their fleet
- eventually, the Athenians forced allied states to use Athenian coins, weight and measures
- in rebelled states, Athens set up Athenian outposts, colonies
- When the polis of **Megara** allied with Athens, it enraged the Corinthians at **Korintti**, so they began forming alliances with their neighbors to the south of them
  - Megara had a very strategic location, as they where in the middle of the land-bridge, or the isthmus of Corinth
