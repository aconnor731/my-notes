# Chapter 23: Technical Characteristics of Privileged Senior Securities

## Considerations Generally Applicable to Privileged Issues

| Company A                                                    | Company B                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4% bond selling at 100                                       | 4% bond selling at 100                                       |
| Convertible into stock at 50 (*i.e.*, two shares of stock for $100 bond) | Convertible into stock at 33.33 (*i.e.*, three shares of stock for a $100 bond) |
| Stock selling at 30                                          | Stock selling at 30                                          |

### Terms of the Privilege vs. Prospects for the Enterprise.

- terms are better for Company B since the stock only need advance 3 points to assure a profit, whereas Stock A must advance over 20 points to make a conversion profitable.
- but Company A may double or triple in price whereas Company B might not at all
- **select the right *company* over the issue with the most desirable *terms*.**
- it is not easy to establish that one common stock at a given price is clearly preferable to another stock at its current price.
- if Stock A was more likely to advance to 50 than Stock B to 33.33, Stock A would be selling higher.
- **It is doubtful that a successful policy of buying privileged issues *from the investment approach* can be based primarily upon the purchaser's view regarding the future expansion of the profits of the enterprise.**

### Three Important Elements.

**If a bond selling at par is convertible into stock at 50, and if the stock sells at 30, then the speculative interest amounts to 60% of the commitment, which is the same thing as saying that the current price of the stock is 60% of that needed before conversion would be profitable.**

### *Significance of Call on Large Number of Shares at Low Price.*

If a bond is both well secured and convertible into many shares at a low price, it will have an excellent chance for very large profit without being subject to the offsetting risk of greater loss through a speculative dip in the price of the stock.

### *2 and 3. Closeness and Duration of the Privilege.*

**The nearer the current price of the stock to the level at which conversion or subscription becomes profitable the more attractive does the privilege become.**

## Comparative Merits of the Three Types of Privileges

### Example of Advantage of Unlimited Participation Privilege.

### Participating Issues at Disadvantage, Marketwise.

Although from the standpoint of long-pull-investment holding, participating issues are theoretically the most desirable, they may behave somewhat less satisfactorily in a major market upswing than do convertible or subscription-warrant issues.

- this is because the price of the common stock is made largely by speculators interested chiefly in quick profits, to secure which they need an active market.
- Consequently the speculators are willing to pay several points more for the inferior common issue simply because it can be bought and sold more readily and because other speculators are likely to be willing to pay more for it also.

### Relative Price Behavior of Convertible and Warrant-bearing Issues.

### Advantage of Separability of Speculative Component.

The speculative component of subscription-warrant issues can be entirely separated from their investment component (*i.e.*, the bond or preferred stock ex-warrants).

These speculators greatly prefer buying the option warrants to buying a corresponding *convertible bond*, because the latter requires a much larger cash investment per share of common stock involved.

### Second Advantage of Warrant-bearing Issues.

Participating *bonds* are generally limited in their right to participate in surplus earnings and are commonly callable.

A callable feature is technically a serious drawback because it may operate to reduce the duration of the privilege. Conceivably a convertible bond may be called just when the privilege is about to acquire real value.

### Third Advantage of Warrant-bearing Issues.

Courses of conduct open to holders of each type in the favorable event that the company prospers, that a high dividend is paid on the common, and that the common sells at a high price.

1. Holder of a participating issue:
   1. May sell at a profit.
   2. May hold and receive participating income.
2. Holder of a convertible issue:
   1. May sell at a profit.
   2. May hold but will receive no benefit from high common dividend.
   3. May convert to secure larger income but sacrifices his senior position.
3. Holder of an issue with stock-purchase warrants:
   1. May sell at a profit.
   2. May hold but will receive no benefit from high common dividend.
   3. May subscribe to common to receive high dividend. He may invest new capital, or he may sell or apply his security ex-warrants to provide funds to pay for the common. In either case he undertakes the risks of a common stockholder in order to receive the high dividend income.
   4. **May dispose of his warrants at a cash profit and retain his original security, ex-warrants. (The warrant may be sold directly, or he may subscribe to the stock and immediately sell it at the current indicated profit.)**
      1. no other option has this great feature

### Summary

To summarize this section, it may be said that, for long-pull holding , a sound participating issue represents the best form of profitsharing privilege. From the standpoint of maximum price advance under favorable market conditions, a senior issue with detachable stock-purchase warrants is likely to show the best results. Furthermore, subscription-warrant issues as a class have definite advantages in that the privilege is ordinarily not subject to curtailment through early redemption of the security, and they permit the realization of a speculative profit while retaining the original investment position.
