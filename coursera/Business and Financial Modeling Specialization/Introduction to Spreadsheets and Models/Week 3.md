# Week 3

## 3.0 Introduction

### Module topics

- Random variables
- Probability distributions in spreadsheets
- Power, exponential and log functions in model formulas
- Models for calculating probability trees and decision trees
- Correlations between variables and spreadsheet statistical functions
- Regression tools in spreadsheets for making predictions
- Multiple regression

## 3.1 Random variables and probability distributions

### Module 3 Lecture 1 Learning objectives

- Implementing random variables using the functions `rand()` and `randbetween()`
- Developing forecasts using historical data to project future events
- Understanding probability distributions as they affect models
- Using built-in spreadsheet statistical functions

Re-calculate spreadsheet values with `F9`

## 3.2 Changes in discrete and continuous time

Columns signify passage of time, in discrete time.

You can model in continuous time.

### Module 3 Lecture 2 Learning objectives

- Calculating change in variables in discrete and continuous time
- Redesigning model objective functions to accommodate continuous time.

Continuous model: $ P_{future} = P_{base}e^{rt} $

## 3.3 Power, exponential, and log functions

### Module 3 Learning objectives

- Using power, exponential and log functions in model formulas
