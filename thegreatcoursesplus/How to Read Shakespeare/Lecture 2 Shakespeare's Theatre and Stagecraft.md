# Lecture 2: Shakespeare's Theatre and Stagecraft

### Tools of Stagecraft:

We can immensely understand how the plays work and why they work this way even today if we have an understanding of the theatre Shakespeare wrote for.

Shakespeare was simultaneously a playwright, an actor, and a shareholder in his playwright's company (received part of the profits from every playwright)

- he knew how to exploit it to the fullest
- it was a business

He prospered.

- By the early 1600s, he purchased a large piece of land and purchased the family's coat of arms his father longed for.

Hamlet Act 3, Scene 2: Play within a play

- his father's ghost tells Hamlet he must enact vengeance for his murder from his uncle, Claudius
- So, Hamlet needs to test his uncle's guilt. How best to do so? Hamlet devises a play before the King in which the murder the ghost told him is acted out.

Claudius very conscious by watching the play will be revealed.

### We must watch for the "play within the play"

- it shows us how Shakespeare thought of the drama

The play is called the Murder of Gonzago

- Hamlet is the producer and playwright

- and he explains it to the audience like he is the director too

- **we see a glimpse of how Shakespeare wanted his plays performed**

  - "Don't overdo it, let it be natural"

  - "Suit the action to the word,

    the word to the action,

    with this special observance,

    that you o'erstep

    not the modesty of nature.

    For anything so o'erdone is

    from the purpose of playing,

    whose end, both at the first and now,

    was and is to hold as 'twere

    the mirror up to nature." (Act III, Scene 2)

    - **It's as if Shakespeare is handing us a major tool to understanding his work**:
      - **Mimesis = imitation**

We must remind ourselves that these plays have this natural quality: trying to imitate life itself.

- the plots have absurd characters and stuff, but the goal is to offer an image of what our own life is like

This also gives us clues on how to read Shakespeare aloud

### Important point: Read Shakespeare aloud

- on the page, words might seem confusing, then reading aloud provides clarity

All art has a history.

If we could understand where Shakespeare came from, then we'll be better able to understand the works he created.

**Where did Shakespeare's plays come from?**

In 1576, James Burbidge opens a theatre in central London, thus creating the theatre as we know it.

City at the time, was controlled by the strict Puritans, who despised the theatre as going against the will of God.

In Shakespeare's days, it was illegal to have women on stage.

The puritans outlawed theatre within city limits, so Shakespeare and company built their Globe theatre across the River Thames.

- among the whore houses, gambling, of license

Shakespeare was more at home with the tavern and inn-keepers rather than the upper classes

### Broad society tool: How Shakespeare shows society's strata

- from the most common workers: bottom in Midsomar's Night Dream
- Shakespeare wanted to know all aspects of society so that he could present it all truthfully on stage, so he could hold that mirror up to nature

As many as 3,000 per play: a huge attendance for a population of 200,000 of the city

**Soliloquy = solo speech**:

- shared intimacy between actor and audience

Shakespeare's stage was really quite bare

More intimate theatre in Staunton, Virginia

Shakespeare's theatre was not realistic, but rather the illusion had to be accepted by the audience: **Contract with the audience**

Costumes were quite elaborate, the cost constituting the bulk of the production's budget.

**Rich costumes and bare stages**

**Important**:

- Play within the play
- Mirror up to nature, imitate the real living world
- Read Shakespeare aloud
- Aim for a natural unadorned speaking style
- Keep the stage tools in our mind:
  - key props
  - the bare stage, elaborate costumes

Why it's so hard to understand: the conventions are 400 years old.

- but if we can understand these conventions, we can enjoy the plays
