## The Polis and Greeks Overseas

### Week 2 / Lecture 1: The *Polis*

Moving from the 3 century period, the Dark Ages, after Mycenae collapsed.

Now, we move to the Archaic Age, also a 3 century period (800 - 500 BC)

- for a very long time, it was eclipsed by the glory of the classical period in the 5th century with its temple and its plays, etc.
- Now, the Archaic Age is realized to be one of the most important formative periods in Greek history.
- So much going on with the economy, military practice, agriculture, social values, law, etc.

We see a uniquely Greek cultural identity.

- date to start looking: 776 BCE, the date of the first Olympic games
- one of the few genuine dating methods that spanned across the entire Greek world
- this is the time that Greek identity became distinct from the other Eastern Mediterranean communities

What were some of the elements?

- Homer is a defining cultural entity

- The Polis, the sort of community the Greeks adopted

  - in the Odyssey, Odysseus saw the towns and learned the minds of many different men.

    - all different communities, but all have a sort of three part division: king, council, and assembly
      - king is the leader in battle, can be the high priest and chief judge
      - the Council, often made up of elders, advisers to the King
      - the assembly is generally made up of the army

  - this is sort of the base for the development of the polis

  - The Polis:

    ![polis](./images/polis.png)

    - both on the mainland, the islands, on the coast of Asia Minor.

- Aristotle lived and wrote in the 4th Century BCE, in a time when the polis was already, as an institution, in decline.

  - we can start with his analysis

- Some Key Terms:

  - `Polis`: clumsily translated in English to "City-State"
    - two principle features: an internal unity, and an independence from communities nearby
    - **essential fact of it is that it included both the urban center and the farmland around it**
      - citizens from the farmland were had the same status of citizenry as those in downtown Athens
  - `Politeia`: incredibly complicated to describe:
    - Constitution, Citizen Body, Citizenship
  - `Polites`: someone who participates, who is an actor in the Polis, a citizen
    - No matter the Polis, the Polites were always and only native-born, free, adult male
      - women, foreigners, children, slaves were excluded from full participation in political life
  - ![map of Ancient Greece](./images/map_of_Ancient_Greece.jpg)
  - ![polis size](./images/polis-size.png)
    - the Polis varied greatly in size:
      - Attika, very large for a Polis, about 1,000 square miles
      - Sparta, in the south, with its possession of Mycenae (3,300 square miles)
      - Korintti, enormously important Polis for the entire period we will be studying, 340 square miles, some of the island communities were smaller yet

- Aristotle defines the first association of human beings as the **Household**, then they agglomerate into **Villages**, then by a process called by the great historian Louis Mumford called, an **urban implosion**, called **Synoecism**, the villages come together to form a polis.

- Urban core, sites of administrative buildings, the shrine, the market, but to repeat, it was one part of the whole of the polis

  - centered around the Acropolis

- ideology of equality underlies it all

- responsibilities and obligation towards their communities

- Aristotle thought highly of the Polis

- Polis is at the root of all the western words: politics, police, policy

- story of Theseus, the mythical king of Athens

  - his story is the myth for the creation of the polis in Athens
  - he goes to Crete and defeats the Minotaur
  - Plutarch tells us when Theseus returns to Athens, he has a great idea, combining the communities into one great community (Synoecism)
  - he sets up a temple, a common shrine, where everyone can come to worship Athena
  - he sets up games, a marker of community identity, not a trivial thing
  - also welcomed in foreigners
  - sets up a polity, a community, called Athens, citizens of Athena

- For Aristotle, the Polis is a location where human beings are meant to live

- someone who lives outside of a polis, he is either a beast or a god

- the intensity of the connection between the citizen and the city-state might be something we don't understand

- in the Archaic Age, the polis starts to be diffused

### Week 2 / Lecture 2: "The Greeks Overseas": Colonization

- around 750 to 700 BC, the polis was pretty well established
- one reason to its ascent: new type of farming, intensive
  - in the Odyssey, Odysseus visits his father Laertes on a farm like this
- Greeks started to move
  - possible reason is not having enough room for people to have these farms
- always some kind of crisis at home
- some key terms:
  - `Metropolis`: mother city
  - `Apoikia` - colony
  - `Oikistes` - the founder who set this whole community up, Theseus for example
- Mount Parnassus, the place of the temple of Apollo
  - Delphi belonged to all the Greeks, it was not under control of a single community
  - it was pan-hellenic
  - two main functions:
    - purification: murder had pollution, and it had to go to Delphi to get official purification before he could be readmitted to the community
    - prophecy: ask the priestess a question and get an answer
- pilgrimage from all over to Delphi
- before going to Delphi you would leave a small offering to your local shrine
- people would talk about what was happening in their local community
- to start a community you had to go to Delphi first to get approval (example, founding of Cyrene in Africa)
- two great waves of Greek colonization:
  - first in the mid-8th century in the west to Italy and Sicily
  - second in the Northeast towards the Black Sea
- these were organized shifts of migration
- the colonization movement began in the West
- the first colony was in the bay of Naples
  - why would they travel so far? **Iron**
  - Greeks were inclined to travel enormous distance to acquire it
- **Nestor's Cup**:
  - some of the earliest inscribed Greek writing on it
- the Greeks discovered writing again, no longer Linear-B, the clumsy 87 character syllabary, but in the form of the 24 character alphabet, borrowed from the Phoenicians, that is the foundation of most modern alphabets
- next? Colonies are established all of the Greek area
- Criteria to form a new area:
  - defensible
  - good airable land
  - natural resources
  - accessibility to trade
- Remember Odysseus scouting Cyclops' island thinking it would be a good place to set up a community
- Cyrene
  - from Herodotus
- in almost all colonial narratives, in the mother city, there is some kind of crisis, trouble
- for Cyrene, the mother city is Thera, a little island in the Cyclides
- they have a drought
- they get a prophecy to Delphi and they dodge it
- they go back to the prophet at Delphi and he reiterates to set up a colony in Libya
- they finally do, the drought ends, Battis is honored for starting it
- **unlike colonialism in the West, these colonies were not dependent on their mother city**
  - they were intended to be an autonomous, independent city
- nothing like the New World colonies that were established by the European colonies
- we are seeing the spread of `polis`, the Hellenization of the Mediterranean
- Greek influence was making itself felt far and wide

### Week 2 / Lecture 3: Literacy, Lawgivers and Law Codes

- explosion of activity that characterized the Archaic Age:
  - Homer
  - the establishment of the polis as an institution
  - polis spread through colonization
  - recovered literacy
- Minoan and Mycenaeans were literate with Linear-A and Linear-B, but it was restricted to a very small group of people: scribes who took noted the inventory
- Greeks rediscovered literacy from the alphabet of the Phoenicians
  - still far away from universal literacy, but still much more widespread
  - it was used to create a new kind of poetry
  - it was also used to record law
- in the Dark Ages, a class of people grew called themselves "The Good People," the "**Agathoi**"
  - hereditary landowners
  - had the best flocks, the best land, the most wealth, etc.
- Hesiod complains about the "bribe devouring lords" who deprived him of his inheritance.
- These bribe-devouring Lords came to be challenged by law-givers, like the great Athenian law-giver Solon.
- **some key terms**:
  - **Nomos**:
    - almost undefinable complexity
    - means law, but more specifically, law sanctioned by long usage, custom
    - the way that communities, cities, cultures define themselves
  - **Eunomia**:
    - having good laws and well-obeyed, lawfulness
- What is it that gave rise to the codification of law to writing these things down?
  - part of it is the polis ideology: ideologically equal citizens with equal claim to the law
  - economic and social stress with new standards wealth
  - almost certainly due to colonization due to these organized dispension of groups of people
- some of these places had settlers from different mother cities, they had to find a way to harmonize
- he worked on the "figure of the law-giver"
  - very, very important
  - historical and legendary figures of law-givers
    - their stories fall into a common pattern
- some kind of crisis in the home state
- the old customs aren't working well enough to hold this in check
- the community chooses one man who is virtuous, uniquely able to create a good code
  - Solon "traveled widely", like Odysseus he saw the towns and learned the minds of many different men
  - gave him great perspective to create a code that works
- he establishes a code that everyone can appeal to
- the story typically includes some kind of challenge to the code that has to be overcome
- very often, it involves the law-giver himself transgressing one of his own laws
  - one example, in Sicily, he broke the law by forgetting to leave his dagger outside of the assembly, he did not exempt himself and instead murdered himself
- this leads us to the next part of this: these stories almost always include the death or the departure of the lawgiver
  - because as long as he is around, he retains his ability, potentially, to change his own code
  - in other words, the ideology that the law is superior to the individual
    - like Aristotle saying the polis is greater than the individual
- Solon and Lycurgus of Sparta, two lawgivers
- also seeing the replacement of clan-based, individual-based justice, from the "bribe-devouring lords" for instance, with a justice that can apply to all members of a community: **good laws well obeyed**
- earliest law codes found at Gortes, in Southern Crete, "code of Gorton"
  - is read left to right, then the next line is from right to left
  - is later than the period we are talking about, around 500
  - is exemplary of these early codes, if it elevates a character of a community, you know it is a fake
  - criminal laws and laws that include who can write a will
  - don't think of these as good models of enlightened thinking, instead think of them as a good example of **order** that defines a community: from an individual, clan-based justice to one that applies to all in the community
- another great change in the Archaic Age: **laws of War**

### Week 2 / Lecture 4: The Works of Ares: Hoplite Warfare

- hoplites were foot soldiers in the wealthier city-states of seventh century B.C. Greece.
  - were often praised in art of the time due to their military service as a primary distinction of citizenship
  - a mark of status and often of wealth as well as a means of attaining glory
  - the initiatives to standardize the Homeric epics in written form fostered a broader interest in heroic subject matter.
- Solon filtered citizens into the military based on their class status, split into four classes
- the hoplites were the second from the top and their phalanx remained the most important fighting unit for centuries
- many changes including economic
- wealth was defined by as Hesiod said, "the corn in one's barn," agriculture, land ownership passed to land
- new form of wealth emerged, **movable wealth**
- tokens from clans, metal, coinage
- no longer land ownership, now it is a bag of gold
- new middle class, not bourgeoise
  - between the Agathoi of old, and the people just barely subsisting
- also, a change in military tactics
- in Iliad, a mass of anonymous fighters among the heroes
- the hoplite reform
- hoplite:
  - heavily armed soldier in tight formation to provide protect the guy on your left whose right side is holding the spear and is unprotected
  - new kind of class:
    - the farmers, with their intensively worked private land
    - setting aside new form of wealth to purchase this armor
    - helmet, breast plate, 1 meter diameter shield, short stabbing spear, some kind of corset, shin guards
    - shield would be wooden frame with bronze covering it, more for display than protection
  - the ideal in combat was to maintain your place in line
  - whichever line broke first would be defeated
  - injuries were horrific, below the shield, groin, or above, with the neck
  - battles could last very long time, after the winners would allow the losers to collect their dead
- new kind of structure in many different sorts of ways:
  - polis
  - lawgivers and law codes, equanamity
  - line in battles as well, communities defending themselves
    - Homeric heroism does not have much space
    - "stand firm," "maintain your place"
- the ideology of the hoplite: **defending himself and his community**
- in the Greek polis, there was no professional bureaucracy nor professional army, farmers would return to their farm
- Marx - "All that is solid melts to the air"
