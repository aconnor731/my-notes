## Principles by Ray Dalio: Notes

At Bridgewater, he had his employees note their errors in an *error log*, and instead of firing people over mistakes, he would discuss the mistake to ensure it could be avoided in the future. This created an environment of openness instead of people hiding their mistakes.

His "Holy Grail" of investing had many important findings:

When faced with the choice between two things you need that are seemingly at odds, go slowly to figure out how you can have as much of both as possible. There is almost always a good path that you just haven't figured out yet, so look for it until you find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent to you.

Ray's and his company's **Work Principles**:

1. Put our honest thoughts out on the table,
2. Have thoughtful disagreements in which people are willing to shift their opinions as they learn, and
3. Have agreed-upon ways of deciding (e.g., voting, having clear authorities) if disagreements remain so that we can move beyond them without resentments.

Ray: "I believe that for any organization or for any relationship to be great, these things are required. I also believe that for a group decision-making system to be effective, the people using have to belive that it's fair."

Ray talked with psychologists, neuroscientists, and educators and learned there are two parts to each brain: the upper-level logical part and the lower-level emotional part...While the logical part of people's brains could easily understand that knowing one's weaknesses is a good thing (because it's the first step toward getting around them), the emotional part typically hates it.
