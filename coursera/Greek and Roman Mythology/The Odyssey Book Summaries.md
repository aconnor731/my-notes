Line 18: Athena says to Telemachus, "Telemachus, no more shyness, this is not the time!"

King Nestor of Pylios fought with King Odysseus at Troy.

- he does not know what happened to his father, Odysseus, because half of the forces at Troy stayed behind while the other half fled.

Orestes killed Aegisthus (his mother and Agamemnon's wife), who'd killed his famous father Agamemnon.

The book finishes with King Nestor's sons accompanying Telemachus on horseback across the landscape of Phylos towards his destination. Athena had left a few days before.
