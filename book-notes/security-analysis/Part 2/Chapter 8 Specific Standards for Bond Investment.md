# Chapter 8: Specific Standards for Bond Investment

## IV. Fourth Principle: Definite Standards of Safety Must Be Applied

If such regulations are desirable in the case of institutions, it should be logical for individuals to follow them also.

### New York Savings-bank Law as a Point of Departure.

This procedure cannot be seriously suggested as a *general principle of investment*, because the legislative provisions are themselves far too imperfect to warrant their acceptance as the best available theoretical standards.

The New York statute, **generally regarded as the best of its class**, is nevertheless marred by a number of evident defects.

- should be used as a guide or point of departure, rather than as a final authority

## General Criteria Prescribed by the New York Statute

The specific requirements imposed by the statute upon bond investments may be classified under seven heads:

1. The *nature* and *location* of the business or government.
2. The *size* of the enterprise, or the issue.
3. The *terms* of the issue.
4. The *record* of solvency and dividend payments.
5. The relation of *earnings* to interest requirements.
6. The relation of the *value* of the property to the funded debt.
7. The relation of *stock* capitalization to the funded debt.

## Nature and Location

Complete exclusions of bonds in certain categories of law-following savings-bank investments:

| Admitted                                                     | Excluded                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| United States government, state and municipal bonds.         | Foreign government and foreign corporation bonds.            |
| Railroad bonds and electric, as and telephone mortgage bonds. | Street railway and water bonds. Debentures of public utilities. |
| Bonds secured by first mortgages on real estate.             | All industrial bonds. Bonds of financial companies (investment trusts, credit concerns, etc.). |

### The Fallacy of Blanket Prohibitions

There are strong objections to the application of blanket prohibitions of the kind now under discussion.

**Investment theory should be chary of easy generalizations.**

### Individual Strength May Compensate for Inherent Weakness of a Class.

### The 1938 Amendment to the Banking Law.

### Obligations of Foreign Governments.

In the final analysis through the first World War, a foreign-government **debt is an unenforceable contract.**

- the investor is practically helpless in the event that these pledges are broken

*The Foreign-trade Argument*.

It is generally argued that a renewal of large-scale international lending is necessary to restore world equilibrium.

As a *speculative operation*, the purchase of foreign obligations at low prices, such as prevailed in 1932, might prove well justified by the attendant possibilities of profit; but these tremendously depreciated quotations are in themselves a potent argument against later purchases of new foreign issues at a price close to 100% of face value, no matter how high the coupon rate may be set.

*The Individual-record Argument*.

Some nations deserve a high credit rating based on their past performance, and these are entitled to investment preference to the same degree as are domestic corporations with satisfactory records.

**It would be well if the investor approached them in the light of *exceptions* to a general rule of avoiding foreign bonds, and required them accordingly to present exceptionally strong evidence of stability and safety.**

### Bonds of Foreign Corporations.

In *theory*, bonds of a corporation, however prosperous, cannot enjoy better security than the obligations of the country in which the corporation is located.

It must be recognized that the conditions resulting in the default of government obligations are certain to affect adversely the position of the corporate bondholder.

Same conclusions as of foreign governments.

## Size

A company of smaller size is more vulnerable than others to unexpected happenings, and it is likely to be handicapped by the lack of strong banking connections or of technical resources.

There is no mathematical means of determining exactly at what point a company or a municipality becomes large enough to warrant the investor's attention.

### Provisions of New York Statute.

### Industrial Bonds and the Factor of Size.

### Large Size Alone No Guarantee of Safety.

The biggest company may be the weakest if its bonded debt is disproportionately large.
