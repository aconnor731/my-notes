## Traditional SEO

- Making it easy for crawlers to do their job
- Increasing the "quality" of your site
- **Unique and targeted** content, including relevant keywords and terminology
- Richness of content
- Frequent updates
- <u>Link building</u>
  - you want sites to refer to your URLs
  - the driving factor to how you show up in search results
- Keyword stuffing (used to work)

### Businesses with a Physical Location

These following tips are useful to build trust and authenticity between search engines and your business.

- Create a complete Google <u>My Business page</u>
  - phone number, address, etc.
- Ask for reviews for your business, and display on your website
- Submit your business to local directories - https://moz.com/local
  - chamber of commerce in your area
- Correct errors/outdated information in <u>Local Citations</u>
- Set specific geographic-targeting in <u>Google Search Console</u>

### PageRank

- Underlying assumption: "quality" of a site is proportional to the number of links to it
- The value of a link on a "quality site" is worth more

- very specific keywords to what you are selling are the most profitable
- "learn javascript" vs "SEO metadata video course"
- you want very specific keywords related to your business rather than broad keywords (a lot of competition over them)

### SEO Traditional Tools

- Discover relevant keywords: <u>Google Keyword Planner</u>
- <u>Google Trends</u>
- specific versus broad terms as broad terms are heavily competitive

### Link Building Campaigns

- Create 'key pages' for popular product and services on your website
  - never change these URLs as you want to reference these a bunch
- Focus inbound links to key pages to build higher ranking pages
- 'Link velocity': rate at which a piece of content or a page earns links over time
- Guest post on trustworthy industry/authority sites
- Analyze competitors' link profile & identify link opportunities: <u>Spyfu</u>

- Indexers don't have to guess so much about connections between things
- More control over the way search results look
