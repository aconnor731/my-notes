# Chapter 16: Income Bonds and Guaranteed Securities

## I. Income Bonds

**Income bond** (a.k.a "adjustment bond"): stands midway between a straight bond and a preferred stock.

- almost always given a long maturity date so that the right of repayment is not likely to be of practical importance int he typical case studied.
- **only one instance of income bondholders actually having received repayment of their principal in full by reason of maturity.**

### Interest Payment Sometimes Wholly Discretionary.

- directors are given practically complete discretion over the amounts to be paid to the bondholders

### Low Investment Rating of Income Bonds as a Class.

- **contractual rights of income bonds are always more or less superior to those of preferred stocks**
  - this does not mean they have a good investment standing as very few cases are good

### Increased Volume of Income Bonds Probable.

### Calculations of Margins of Safety for Income Bonds.

- analysis is identical to a preferred stock for an income-bond exhibit
- minimum earnings coverage recommended in previous chapter for preferred stocks is required also for income bonds when selected as fixed-value investments

### Senior Income Bonds.

## II. Guaranteed Issues

- any guaranty depends strictly upon the financial condition of the guarantor
- if the guarantor has nothing, the guaranty is worthless
- We know of no important case in which a solvent company has escaped the consequences of its guaranty through legal technicalities

### Status of Guaranteed Issues.

### Exact Terms of Guaranty Are Important.

- A guaranty of interest only is likely to be much less significant than a guaranty of principal as well.

### Joint and Several Guarantees.

- Since two or more sponsors are better than one, bonds bearing a joint and several guarantee are likely to have special advantages.
- **It would seem good policy for investors, therefore, to favor bonds of this type, which carry the guaranty of a *number* of substantial enterprises, in preference to the obligations of a single company.**

### Federal Land Bank Bonds.

- somewhat different aspect of the joint and several guarantee, secured by deposit of farm mortgages

- each Federal Land Bank bond is in reality a liability of the entire system
