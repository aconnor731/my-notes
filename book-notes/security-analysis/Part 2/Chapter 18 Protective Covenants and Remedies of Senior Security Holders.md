# Chapter 18: Protective Covenants and Remedies of Senior Security Holders

In this and the two succeeding chapters we shall consider the provisions usually made **to protect the rights of bond owners and preferred stockholders against impairment**, and the various lines of action which may be followed in the event of nonfulfillment of the company's obligations.

### Indenture or Charter Provisions Designed to Protect Holder of Senior Securities.

**_Indenture_** or **_deed of trust_**: the contract between a corporation and the owners of its bonds.

- rights of preferred stockholders are set for in the Articles, or Certificate, of Incorporation

1. In the case of bonds:
   1. Nonpayment of interest, principal, or sinking fund.
   2. Default on other obligations, or receivership.
   3. Issuance of new secured debt.
   4. Dilution of a conversion (or subscription) privilege.
2. In the case of preferred stocks:
   1. Nonpayment of (cumulative) preferred dividends for a period of time.
   2. Creation of funded debt or a prior stock issue.
   3. Dilution of a conversion (or subscription) privilege.

**Acceleration clauses**: purpose is to enable the bondholders to assert the full amount of their claim in competition with the other creditors.

### Contradictory Aspects of Bondholders' Legal Rights.

As we pointed out in a former chapter, the market's appraisal of a bond in default is no higher on the whole, and perhaps lower, than that of a non-dividend-paying preferred stock of a solvent company.

As long as the interest or principal is not going to be paid anyway, would it not be to the interest of the bondholders themselves to postpone the date of payment and keep the enterprise out of the courts?

### Corporate Insolvency and Reorganization.

### Tendency of Securities of Insolvent Companies to Sell below Their Fair Value.

Considering an example of Studebaker Corporation, the company's debt, selling at 40 cents on the dollar, was entitled to *prompt payment in full* before the stockholder received anything. Nevertheless, the market placed a much larger value upon the stock issues than upon the prior debt.

### Voluntary Readjustment Plans.

### Change in the Status of Bond Trustees.

### The Problem of the Protective Committee.

### A Recommended Reform.
