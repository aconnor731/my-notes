# Nonverbal Empathy

Nonverbal empathy is actually very simple.

Similar to the way that body language boils down to just two signals, there are only two nonverbal empathy options you need to worry about: **whether to be high-energy or low-energy.**

#### High and Low Energy Defined

When someone is **high energy**, they tend to act:

- Excited
- Expressive
- Loud

In contrast, when someone is low energy, they tend to act:

- Reserved
- Relaxed
- Quiet

These aren't always accurate.

Note that people will feel high-energy sometimes and low-energy other times.

When you see your friend in a moment of excitement, you should conclude "My friend is feeling high-energy right now." rather than decide "My friend is always high-energy."

#### Energy and Empathy

How does high-energy and low-energy apply to empathy?

If your partner is high-energy, **try to be high-energy.**

And if your partner is low-energy, **try to be low-energy**.

Match your partner's energy level.

When you monitor the energy levels of those around you and adjust your own energy level accordingly, you'll find connecting with others to be much easier.
