## 7: How to Get Cooperation

Don't you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself than in ideas that are handed to you on a silver platter? If so, isn't it bad judgment to try to ram your opinions down the throats of other people? Isn't it wiser to make suggestions-and let the other person think out the conclusion.

No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.

Letting the other person feel that the idea is his or hers not only works in business and politics, it works in family life as well.

The others had been trying to sell me on their service, but one let me sell myself. That organization won.

**Lao-tse, the Chinese sage said, "The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury."**

**<u>Principle 7</u>: Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.**

Along with Lincoln and Roosevelt, you will have grasped the only solid foundation for interpersonal relationships; **success in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the other person's viewpoint.**

In his book *Getting Through to People*, Dr. Gerald S. Nirenberg commented: "Cooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person's ideas and feelings as important as your own. Starting your conversation by giving the other person the purpose or direction of your conversation, governing what you say by what you would want to hear if you were the listener, and accepting his or her viewpoint will encourage the listener to have an open mind to your ideas."

**_I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person's office for two hours before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person--from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives--was likely to answer._**

**<u>Principle 8:</u> Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.**
