# Chapter 3: Sources of Information

## Data on the Terms of the Issue

The typical case the analyst seeks data regards:

1. the terms of the specific issue
2. the company
3. the industry

## Data on the Company

### Reports to Stockholders (Including Interim News Releases)

**The chief source of statistical data is the reports issued to the stockholders.**

The ruling policy of public-utility companies varies between *quarterly* and *monthly* statements.

Figures regularly include:

- gross
- net after taxes
- balance for dividends

**Publication of results quarterly is considered as the standard procedure in nearly all lines of industry.**

**Every listed company publishes an annual report of some kind.**

- **The distinguishing feature of the annual report, however, is that it invariably presents the balance-sheet position.**

The form of the balance sheet is better standardized than the income account, and it does not offer such frequent grounds for criticism.

### Periodic Reports to Public Agencies

Railroads and most public utilities are required to supply information to various federal and state commissions.

- usually more detailed than the statements to shareholders

### Listing Applications

In pre-S.E.C. days these were the most important nonperiodic sources of information.

They were required by the New York Stock Exchange.

### Registration Statements and Prospectuses

These data are contained in registration statements filed with the Commission in Washington and available for inspection or obtainable in copy upon payment of a fee.

There is no doubt that this material is proving of the greatest value to the analyst and through him to the investing public.

### Miscellaneous Official Reports

### Statistical and Financial Publications

Most of the information required by the securities analyst in his daily work may be found conveniently and adequately presented by the various statistical services.

- **Comprehensive manuals published annually with periodic supplements (Poor's, Moody's)**
- **descriptive stock and bond cards**
- **manuals frequently revised (Standard & Poor's, Fitch)**
- **daily digests of news relating to individual companies (Standard Corporation Records, Fitch)**

They cannot be relied upon to give all the data available in the various original sources above described.

**The analyst should consult the original reports and other documents wherever possible, and not rely upon summaries or transcriptions.**

In the field of financial periodicals, special mention must be made of **_The Commercial and Financial Chronicle_**, a weekly publication with numerous statistical supplements.

- unusually comprehensive regarding the financial and industrial field

### Requests for Direct Information from the Company

**It must never be forgotten that a stockholder is an *owner* of the business and an *employer* of its officers.**

He is entitled not only to ask legitimate questions but also to have them answered, unless there is some persuasive reason to the contrary.

**The courts have generally held that a bona fide stockholder has the same right to full information as a partner in a private business.**

## Information Regarding the Industry

The *Survey of Current Business*, published by the United States Department of Commerce, gives monthly figures on output, consumption, stocks, unfilled orders, etc., for many different lines.

Annual data are contained in:

- the Statistical Abstract
- the World Almanac
- and other compendiums

More detailed figures are available in the Biennial Census of Manufactures.
