## Week 6

#### 6.1: Introduction to the Homeric Hymns

- much more likely that they were written people that followed Homer
- from Greek word "Hymnos"
- individual hymns honor individual divinities
- we will focus on just two hymns: The Homeric hymn to Apollo and the Homeric hymn to Demeter
  - we will read the longer and extended versions
- they will give us insight to common themes in this type of writing
- they use the same meter
- temples are called out in hymns, this is pretty common in these hymns
- we talk directly to the god itself sometimes
- some narrative elements like goodbyes from the poet
- will see characteristic themes like getting to know the god
- first, the gods will be born: they don't just exist like some divinities
- they want to find some place on Earth they can call home
- they typically suffer pain or isolation to find these spots
- they will have certain claim over certain universal properties
- they have to find people to do things for them and worship them
- they really like being worshiped
- ritual background is very important

### 6.2: Ritual and Religion

- use "cult" to label ritual activity in honor of a god
- use the city as a way to have camaraderie
- time of the calendar
- festivals locations are notable
- common ritual activities:
  - purification
    - in a river, or any body of water
  - put on special clothing
  - processions
    - long march to some temple as a dedication
  - fasting
  - certain foods for these rituals
    - only eat/drink at certain times connected with ritual
  - sacrifice
    - bulls
    - larger the mammal, the better
    - prepare the animal, purification
    - decorate the animal
    - it is killed in honor of the divinity
    - carve up the meat and share to your people
    - thigh bones wrapped in fat go to the gods, the rich meat goes to the people
    - pigs, goats, poultry
    - not fish and neither other kinds of birds
    - non-animal sacrifice too, plants
    - common all around the Mediterranean world
- sacrifices are a demand from the gods
- sacrifices are a way of surrendering humans' own guilt
- killing the animal reinforces humans' own mortality with respect to the deathless gods they sacrifice to
- wine is an important part of the ritual, libations, and consumption
  - drunk in excess sometimes
  - typical in all ancient ritual that wine is a part of it, drunkenness is typical, but excessive drunkenness is idiosyncratic to Dionysus
- Games, theater, contests, etc.
  - long weekend festival to Athena
  - closing off ceremony would involve singing, a perfect place for a hymn

## 6.3: The Hymn to Demeter

- Homeric Hymn to Demeter
- Demeter was connected with her daughter, Persephone, who went astray and got sucked down to the underworld
- Her mother is upset and connects with the Earth and the fertility of it
- themes of pre and post child-bearing years, including during child-bearing years

#### From Athens to Eleusis

#### Eleusinian Mysteries

- In Eleusis is where the ceremony is held

- 9 day ritual

- When Demeter arrives at Eleusis, she is trying to work out her grief for the lost of her daughter

- There are connections between the Homeric hymn to Demeter and the Eleusinian mysteries

- one is a **location** connection at Eleusis

- fertility is a theme

- secrecy and initiation into these mysteries

- 9 day period for the Eleusinian mysteries

- Demeter asks for a special drink other than wine, consisting of barley-wine and ...

- a character, Yombai, comes along to cheer Demeter up

- this refers to Yombas, which is nasty and satirical epithets

- it is part of the festival

- a promise in the Eleusinian mysteries of a better afterlife

- usually, an occultic ritual consists of gifts, not a promise of a better afterlife

  - this is unusual since in Greek culture, it is much better to be alive than dead

- this better afterlife is like getting a special code to the admirals club when you are stuck in an airport terminal

- Persephone, a kind of mortal god

- a connection between mortality and immortality

- exclusive rights at Eleusis included secrecy

- From Clement of Alexandria, a Christian, in *Exhortation to the Greeks 2.21*, he reveals the secrets to the Eleusinian mysteries.

  ```
  I have fasted.
  I have drunk the mixture.
  I have taken from the box.
  Having done the deed,
  I put it back into the basket,
  and out of the basket into the box.
  ```

## 6.4: Themes in The Hymn to Demeter

- strong focus on women's experience
- the main point of the Odyssey was the gender of male
- for the Hymn to Demeter, the main point is the gender of female
- couple of important pair of figures:
  - Metaneira // Demeter
  - Demophoon // Persephone
- Metaneira is nearing her child-bearing years
- She was waiting and praying for Demophoon to come
- She is nearing the end of her child-bearing years
- Then she must take care of her child
- Demeter, in her disguise, is beyond her child-bearing years
  - she is cast aside
  - call her granny
  - has an appearance "long caught off from child-bearing"
  - limited responsibilities in these later stages of life: a house maid or a nurse, not something as grand as a mother or a head of a household
- Metaneira, by contrast, can have those roles
  - she has a head of a household
  - her reproductive powers in fullness has been shown through this child, which gives her influence and authority
  - Demeter is deprived of those aspects since she no longer can bear children
- Persephone is making a certain transition of living as a girl with her mother to living with a man
  - it is the single most dramatic moment in the story (always bad drama)
  - it is portrayed as violent
  - introduction into the man's household is filled with fear, isolation, and a loss of innocence
  - she has to re-imagine her relationships that were most dear to her with her mother and others
    - this is an explicit parallel of being moved from her mother's home to the man's home as a kind of death (going into the underworld)
  - she lives as an immortal experiencing the life of a mortal after death
  - transitioning from a girl in childhood to adulthood is characterized as a death
  - also characterized as entering a life stage of fertility
    - her relationships with men will change
    - the pomegranate scene likely symbolizes the seed of the man and the fact that she took it in changes her status completely
      - when she comes back and has a moment of audience with her mother, her mother asks her "have you eaten anything?"
        - this has a certain kind of pain and loss
- together, Persephone makes an interesting pair with Demophoon
- Demophoon is the missing aspect that Demeter has due to her loss of Persephone
  - Demeter then has a sort of investment with bringing in Demophoon
- Demeter tries to bring Demophoon from a mortal to an immortal by feeding him ambrosia, the food of the gods
  - when humans eat more of the food of the gods, the more they become a divinity itself
- Strange custom of bearing him in the fire
  - a linkage to blacksmithing by making metal stronger and more durable
- Demeter thinks she will create an immortal character as a recompense to the loss of her daughter
- Demophoon is making the transition to immortality, Persephone is an immortal becoming more mortal
- The book ends around the question of death and immortality
- A lot of meditation around this question of reproduction:
  - human fertility and its complexity, these are the themes that are built into this story
  - each are connected with this question of mortality and immortality
  - each time we see these new lives, we are awestruck at the miracle of birth, and also a reminder of our own mortality
- a promise of immortality is tinged always with the spectre and presence of mortality
- the author is telling us we cannot really have one without the other: we can't have this reproductive desire to produce offspring without mortality and death that comes with it
- Another character in the household is Triptolemus
- this story shows what it means to be human and this drama is put on over to the gods
  - these characters are immortal but boy do they sure seem to be human

## 6.5: The Hymn to Apollo: Delos

- has two separate hymns: Pythian and Delian, by our translator Sarah Ruden
  - we don't know for sure if they were two separate hymns, but it is likely
- we hear "Goodbye Apollo" twice, which is helpful to determine it is actually two hymns to Apollo
- Apollo is a very powerful god, frightening
- we hear Leto's journey of going place to place trying to give birth to Apollo, but each place is terrified of her child
- Apollo and Artemis come out of Leto
- when she finds the place to give birth, at the house of Delos, and Leto promises immense wealth will be given to Delos
- Leto then enters 9 days of labor, unbelievable
- Apollo emerges and declares his purview: prophecy
  - he is careful to say that he will have the purview of prophecy of Zeus
  - he is careful not to challenge Zeus
- Apollo then lists how he wants to be worshipped
  - Delian maidens singing in Apollo's honor
- An occult is established at Delos
- there is no distinct end with this manuscript: one feeds into the other
- Some will say the most important location to Apollo is Delos
- Others would say the most important site is Delphi
- This hymn gives way to say that both are

## 6.6: The Hymn to Apollo: Delphi
