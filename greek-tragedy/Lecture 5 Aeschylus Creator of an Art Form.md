# Lecture 5: Aeschylus: Creator of an Art Form

First of the three great tragedians, Aeschylus

Born at Eleusis, home of the important cult of Eleusinian belief

- first victory at Dionysus of 484 B.C.
- probably born in the 520s

Know very little about his life

- we do know he fought in the Persian wars
- in his epitaph, he mentioned this fight, but not that he wrote tragedy

He died in Sicily, away from Athens

Won a total of 13 victories

Another source says 28 times, likely won after his death against modern competitors

- re-entering his work attests to how highly he was regarded

According to Aristotle, Aeschylus added the second actor to tragedy, thus "inventing tragedy"

- only upon introducing a second actor can you get "true drama"
- Sophocles added the third actor

Aeschylus favored writing on one story throughout three plays, tragedies, a trilogy (Sophocles and Euripides did not follow this form)

The Oresteia is the only surviving trilogy, held dearly to theater historians

Aeschylus wrote between 70 and 90 plays, only 7 survive

Earliest extant tragedy: **_Persians_**

- used recent history, very unusual

Other plays by Aeschylus: **Suppliant Maidens, Seven Against Thebes**

**_Prometheus Bound_** may not be by Aeschylus, but by his grandson also named Aeschylus

Most notable: **The Oresteia: Agamemnon, Libation Bearers, Eumenides**

**Byzantine Empire**:

- 395 A.D.
- Eastern Empire: capital in Constantinople, Byzantine
  - continued until 1453 A.D.
  - very important political system
  - achieved preservation of many Greek texts, including tragedies
- Western Empire: capital in Rome
  - fell in 476 A.D.

7 of Aeschylus' plays were used in schools

Later, **The Byzantine Triad: Persians, Prometheus Bound, and Seven Against Thebes** were given to schoolboys

Single manuscript for the Oresteia?

What was it about Suppliant Maidens and Seven Against Thebes that caused them to be preserved?

Main characters in *Persians* are royalty.

*Seven Against Thebes*, 467 B.C.

- Deals with the fight between Oedipus' two sons over who should rule
- they alternate by year rule as King over Thebes

*Suppliant Maidens*

- recounts 50 daughters of a King named Denaes fleeing a forced marriage with their Egyptian cousins
- ask King of Argos for protection from their cousins
- he offers his protection and ends with chorus giving thanks in appreciation
- remaining plays are lost that would explain what would happen after
- the chorus, the Denaids, the women, are the main characters of this play
