# How to Speak How to Listen Notes

Imparting information to an audience that desires the information in question involves neither logical nor rhetorical skill.

One need only speak at a tempo and in a voice that enables the items of information to be heard clearly and distinctly.

The speaker should be able to make a fairly shrewd guess concerning the general character of the views about the subject chosen that are likely to be prevalent among the listeners.

**To persuade listeners to change their minds by adopting views contrary to ones they have persistently and, perhaps, obstinately held, it is necessary to undermine their prejudices in a manner that is as firm as it is gentle.**

Long-standing prejudices are barriers to persuasion. They must be removed before positive persuasion can begin.

**My listeners may harbor prejudices or suspicions about myself that I must overcome before positive persuasion can begin.**

It is important to portray my *ethos* in a favorable light.

I must establish my authority to speak on the subject chosen, if my character and competence has not been conveyed to my audience.

I must also incorporate the *pathos* of the subject.

I should try to arouse emotional responses in my listeners **that are favorable to the course of action I wish them to take**--not only arouse them, but get them flowing steadily in the direction of the action you wish them to engage in.

**The control of *pathos* operates differently in instructive speech that has a <u>theoretical</u>, not a <u>practical</u>, aim.**

I must bring my own emotions, first of all, into play.

I must manifest, as plainly as possible, your own emotional attachment to the views I am presenting.

The thinking you have done privately and are now publicly articulating in your speech must have emotional force as well as intellectual power.

Physical gestures are an important aspect at guiding my audience to understanding the points I am presenting.

**Never talk down to your audience about any subject.**

**Always risk talking over their heads!**

Two cautions with this:

1. Gauge accurately the level of your audience so that you do not so far exceed their grasp that there is nothing for them to hold on to in their effort to reach up.
2. Be sure that there is enough that is well within their grasp so that what they can easily understand gives them a firm intellectual footing from which to stretch their minds.

The truly great books, I have repeatedly said, are the few books that are over everybody's head all of the time.

The only lectures that are intellectually profitable for anyone to listen to are those that increase one's knowledge and enlarge one's understanding.

The logical content of a good lecture or an instructive speech should consist in arguments of extended length and fully explicit about the steps to be taken. **The *logos* should be spelled out in detail.**

Repetitions should be employed rather than avoided.

Boil down the argument into a summary, *here it is in a nutshell.*

Two other Greek words name additional considerations that apply to both instructive and persuasive speech:

- *Taxis*
- *lexis*

Taxis: concerns the organization of speech

3 components:

1. proem: opening or introduction
2. main body of the speech
3. peroration: its closing or conclusion
   1. **it should be brief**: if it is overly wordy, it defeats itself

**In most sales talks, the opening should attempt to establish the speaker's *<u>ethos</u>* first. That should be followed by bringing *<u>pathos</u>* into play. *<u>Logos</u>* should be left until the end.**

At the very beginning, the speaker must not stumble in the least.

In those opening moments, what the speaker has to say should be said loud and clear, in simple forceful sentences, and without any hesitation or backtracking.

Organize the points in the main body of the speech in the order specified by me in my introduction.

**The listeners were told then what the speaker planned to tell them, in what order the telling would take place, and how one thing would lead to another.**

Each of the three sections should end with a brief summary of the topics discussed in that section and each should include a transition to what is coming next.

**Repetitions are necessary in speaking because, unlike written text, the audience cannot return to what was previously said.**

Now the final consideration is the *lexis*:

It concerns the language or literary style of the lecture--the choice of words, the avoidance of ambiguity, or, if ambiguity is unavoidable in the use of certain words, calling attention to it by distinguishing the two or three different but related meanings with which a given word is being used.

**The speaker's vocabulary should be designed so that it is generally consonant with the vocabulary of the audience.**

If I must include words that my audience likely are not familiar with, I need to take special attention to those words and meanings to explain them.

**Jargon and esoteric language should be avoided at all costs.**

The two rules can be summarized as such:

One the one hand, the language employed and the sentences constructed should be clear without being plain. On the other hand, they should have a certain elevation above the ordinary without being obscure.

These rules are easy to state but very hard to follow.
