# Hesiod's Theogony Notes

- Earth (Gaia)
- Sky (Ouranos)
- Sea (Pontos)
  - they are not mere elements, but gods.

The *Theogony* is partly a cosmogony, that is, a poem not only about the birth of the gods and the various divine powers but also about the birth of the multifarious divine universe.

The most familiar type of theogonic literature-in the Hesiodic sense-comes to use from the opening chapters of Genesis.

#### The Kumarbi from Hittite texts and Hurrian origin

The story of Kumarbi comes to us in Hittite texts but is doubtless of Hurrian origin.

In one text, the sky-god Anu defeated Alalu and forced him to flee to the earth.

After Anu reigned in the sky for nine years, he was threatened by Kumarbi and fled up to his own element, the sky, but Kumarbi pursued him, caught him, and then bit off and swallowed his genitals.

The river Tigris and the god Tasmisu are born from what Kumarbi disgorges when warned by Anu about the potential danger from "the three gods" he has swallowed.

But the third god is still inside him.

With the aid of a fabulous emetic and after considerable travail, his body is rid of the third god, who turns out to be the weather-god.

What follows is fragmentary and very unclear, but in a longer text call the *Song of Ullikumni*, Kumarbi gives birth to a mighty child of monstrous size.

This child eventually threatens all the gods, but his feet are cut off and he is finally subdued by the gods.

#### The Babylonian En&ucirc;ma Eli&scaron;

antedate: precede in time; come before (something) in time

It antedates the *Theogony* by as much as five hundred years.

Details do differ, and the Hittite-Hurrian story may in some ways, especially in the castration motif, be somewhat closer to the Hesiodic account, but both the Hittite-Hurrian and the Babylonian theogonies show, in overall terms and patterns, an astounding similarity to the Hesiodic *Theogony*.

#### Norse

In the final battle of the gods (*Ragnar&ouml;k) Thor kills the serpent, even if he is overcome by its venom.

That the ruling gods and men will perish in a final blaze after the dread confrontation of gods and monsters is an element eschatologically so reminiscent of Judaeo-Christian doomsday beliefs that we should, at least tentatively, assume in this account the probability of extraneous influence.

----

Much like Homer's epics, Hesiod's *Theogony* must stand not at the beginning but at the apex of a tradition.

First Olympian generation: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus.

Hesiod, unlike Homer, displays little interest in the Olympians and the capricious side of their behavior. **He is more interested in the gradual evolution of the order that was finally established by Zeus and in the conflict of a world that is not static but dynamic.**

Hesiod's idea of the birth of the world has no truly metaphysical dimension. It is a physical world born not **_ex nihilo_** but **_ex ignoto_**, "from the unknown."

There is no myth that accounts for the creation of man.



## Theogony

Zeus subdued Kronos to establish his supremacy.

Kings are from the line of Zeus.

Muses relieve men from their sorrows, to help them forget for awhile.

Chaos was born first and after it came Gaia

Then Eros.

Chaos gave birth to **Erebos** and **black Night**.

Then **Erebos** mated with **Night** and gave birth to **Ether** and **Day**.

**Gaia** first gave birth to starry **Ouranos**. Then to the tall mountains, then she bore **Pontos**, the barren sea with its raging swell.

**Gaia** did not mate in sweet love to give birth to them.

She then did couple with **Ouranos** to bear deep-eddying **Okeanos**, **Koios** and **Kreios**, **Hyperion** and **Iapetos**, **Theia** and **Rheia**, **Themis** and **Mnemosyne**, as well as gold-wreathed **Phoibe** and lovely **Tethys**.

She gave birth to her last child, **Kronos**, the sinuous-minded, a most fearful child who hated his mighty father.

Then she bore the **Kyklopes**, haughty in their might, **Brontes**, **Steropes**, and **Arges** of the spirit who made and gave to **Zeus** the crushing thunder. In all other respects they were like gods, but they had one eye in the middle of their foreheads, hence the name **Kyklopes**.

They had inventive skill and strength and power in their deeds.

The offspring of **Gaia** all conspired against **Ouranos**, as they hated him, and hacked off his genitals when he came to **Gaia** looking for love.

**Kronos** tossed the genitals into the ocean. They were carried by the sea a long time and all around them a white foam rose from the god's flesh, and in this foam, the majestic and fair goddess **Aphrodite** came out.

**Aphrodite** because she grew out of *aphros*, foam, that is.

She is called Philommedes, fond of a man's genitals, because to them she owed her birth.

The power she has had from the start and her share in the lives of men and deathless gods:

from her come young girls' whispers and smiles and deception and honey-sweet love and its joyful pleasures.

**Ouranos** called his offspring Titans because he said they had, with reckless power, overreached him to do a monstrous thing that would be avenged someday.

**Night** gave birth to hideous **Moros** and **black Ker** and then to **Death** and **Sleep** and to the **brood of Dreams**.

Then loathsome **Strife** bore **Ponos**, the bringer of pains, **Oblivion** and **Famine** and the tearful **Sorrows**, the **Clashes** and the **Battles** and the **Manslaughters**, the **Quarrels** and the **Lies** and **Argument** and **Counter-Argument**, **Lawlessness** and **Ruin** whose ways are all alike, and **Oath**, who, more than any other, brings pains on mortals who of their own accord swear false oaths.

**Kerberos**, the fifty-headed dog of **Hades**

**Echidna**, half nymph and half snake, born from **Keto**.

**Echidna** and **Typhaon**, the lawless and dreadful ravisher, produced **Kerberos**, the fifty-headed dog of **Hades**.

**Rheia** produced with **Kronos** **Hestia**, **Demeter**, **Hera**, imperious **Hades**, **Earthshaker**, and **Zeus**.

As **Kronos** was about to devour **Zeus**, **Rheia** flew to Crete and placed in a cave lodged deep within a sheer cliff of densely wooded Mount Aigaion.
