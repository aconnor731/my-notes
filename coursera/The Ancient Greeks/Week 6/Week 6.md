# Week 6

## Week 6 / Lecture 1: Thucydides the Athenian wrote the War

We know three things happened:

1. In 451, Pericles makes citizen laws stricter
2. In 444, Athens and Sparta sign a treaty of peace for 30 years



### Thucydides

- born ca. 460, son of Oloros
  - came from a very well-to-do family
- Caught and survived the plague in 429/8
- General in the North Aegean, at Amphipolis in 424; defeated by Spartan General Brasidas
- Exiled for 20 years
- Returned to Athens, died ca. 400

#### Influences on how Thucydides sees history

- Sophists - professional teachers of rhetoric.
  - Protagoras, in Athens around 450
  - Gorgias
- Sophistic Antitheses:
  - Law (Nomos) / Nature (Physis)
  - Speech (Logos) / Action (Ergon)
  - Justice (Dikaion) / Expediency (Sympheron)
- Hippocratic Medicine
- Athenian Tragedy

**Other important historian, Herodotus (the first to take on this massive complex narrative)**

Key differences between the two:

- Thucydides is objective, so it seems
  - Herodotus keeps popping up in his own narrative and Thucydides refers to himself only upon his defeat in battle in the third person

## Week 6 / Lecture 2: The Outbreak of the War and Pericles' Strategy

Thucydides 3 causes of the war:

- conflict that arises between the city of Corinth
  - Athens takes the side of Corsyra
  - another conflict with Potadia (very far from Athens)
    - was a Corinthian colony, but a tribute-paying member of the Athenian Confederacy
  - Athenians ordered the Potadians to tear down their walls, so they couldn't protect themselves, so they appealed to their mother city, Corinth. At some point, also appealed to Megara
  - **The Megarian Decree**: Athenians hit Megarians with a total embargo
  - Corinthians tell the Spartan conference that Athenians are always starting new projects, if one fails, they just move onto the next
  - numerous cities had to choose sides between Sparta and Athens
- war breaks out officially in 431 BCE
- Pericles has a radical policy to deal with it
- Athens has a long wall to its harbor city of Piraeus
- Pericles took them into this enclave, radical strategy
  - decided against hoplite warfare since they have the fleet to provide supplies and to raid the Spartan coast
  - the people were very upset with having to leave their deems
- In first year of war, things went according to plan
- **most famous piece of oration in ancient Greece**: Pericles' funeral oration
  - he gives the Athenian vision of Athens
  - he says that Athens is the school of Hellas
  - had served as general of this polis for 14-15 years
  - shortly after this address was delivered, things changed. A plague broke out
- ancient sanitation was never that great to begin with
- medical historians still debate what this might have been:
  - Typhus, typhoid, some kind of Bubonic plague
- effects were devasting
  - estimated up to as much as a third of the Athenian population died
- Sophists: law controls a basically selfish and violent human nature
- Thucydides says that, under the pressure of plague, the laws collapse
- Athenians respond by taking it out on Pericles, as they were enclosed inside the enclave
- mob first in 17 years didn't elect Pericles as general, then Thucydides, who was no fan of the democracy says, as the mob is won't to do, changed its mind and brought him back
- last speech of Pericles:
  - maintain the empire, but don't expand it and keep the faith
- very shortly after this speech, he caught the plague and died
- now we will see what happens in his absence

## Week 6 / Lecture 3: Cleon - A "New Politician" The Peace of Nicias (421)

- Thucydides depicts Pericles as being able to lead the people of Athens without being led by them
  - this combination of characteristics earn Pericles the nickname of the Olympian
- with his death, we see a new type of politician rise exemplified by Cleon
- Athenians had maintained the empire, amazingly enough, the allies had stayed put, after Pericles' death

![allied territory](./images/allied-territory.png)

- Athens still dominated
- Pericles died in 429-428
- then, on the island of Lesbos, the large and powerful Pylos of Mytilene rebelled
- Athens sent a fleet and crushed the rebellion
- Athenians voted to kill the males and sell the women and children into slavery
- Things have changed a lot since Samos
- Athenians repented a lot of this decision and a debate happened between Diodotus, who is otherwise unknown, and Cleon
- Two sources, who both hated him, for Cleon:
  - Thucydides
  - poet Aristophanes
- Cleon:
  - low, vicious, unscrupulous, greedy, cowardly
  - foreign-born
  - stinky, family owned a tannery and freshly tanned hides' smell is awful
- Cleon was at the time was the most violent and most persuasive among the citizens
- Political style is changing
  - brings in a new kind of political vocabulary, somebody called a demagogos: in English, a demagogue: just means a leader of the people
    - another little phrase *prostates tou demou*: the one who stands up for the people
- Pericles had all the advantages of his Almaeonidae ancestry, is wealthy, well educated, he could afford to be Olympian and aloof
- Cleon had to go directly to the people in order to get support for his proposals, which are not that different from what Pericles would have done, we think

- Cleon had never held office as a strategos, which Pericles of course had
- **some people have argued this could be the rise of something akin to a professional political class.**
- Cleon, ironically perhaps, takes the side of justice
  - remember that one of the great Sophistic antithesis between what's just and what's expedient.
- Cleon says it's just to punish the Mytileneans, we'll make an example of them
- Diodotus says it's more advantageous to keep the Mytileneans as tribute paying members of the Confederacy
  - if we inflict the ultimate penalty, anyone else who rebels will know they cannot negotiate
- Diodotus won the day, despite Cleon being the most persuasive
- They send their fastest ship, barely escaping mass slaughter, although 1000 were already killed
- The colony of Corinth falls into civil war, up on the west coast
- It begins with the murder of an official Athenian friend there, the so called Peroxenus, and what we have is political strife
- **Historians: the most bloody wars are civil wars and crusades**
- Thucydides says there were representatives from both Athens and Sparta
  - war of ideology too
- party loyalty becomes supreme, over family even: fathers against sons
- When words change their meaning, and only action is possible, human nature being what it is, that action is going to be self-seeking and violent.
- The ones who suffer the most are the moderates, because they're subject to attack from both sides.
- The following year, Cleon undertakes a mission down to the south, the ancestral home of the old general Nestor from the Illiad, a place called Pylos.
- Cleon wins against the Spartans due to some luck. Then Cleon's influence in Athens is almost unbeatable.
- Either in this year, or the following year, 425-424, Aristophanes' published his earliest comedy: the Acharnians
- While Cleon was in the South, the Spartans had mounted a campaign way up north, in that area around Amphipolis and Potidaea
- They sent out a commander, Brasidas, a new kind of Ephor for Sparta, in that he was bold, innovative and daring
  - he wins several important campaigns and does serious damage to Athenian interests in the area.
- Thucydides is exiled for 20 years
- Then, Cleon is appointed General and he goes north and confronts Brasidas
- Again at Amphipolis, large battle with many more Athenians killed than Spartans, but Brasidas and Cleon are killed
- This is a turning point as Brasidas was the Spartans most brilliant commander
- In 421, the Athenians and their allies sign the peace of Nicias with the Spartans and their allies with the terms to last for 50 years of mutual non-aggression.
- Probably not really a real peace
- Athenians were joyous
- But the peace is fragile
- Thucydides doesn't talk about the opposition at home, which is why we must turn to comedy

## Week 6 / Lecture 4: Comedy and Athenian Civic Life

- tragedy was vitally important in Athenian civic discourse
- comedy, like tragedy, was part of a great civic celebration
- tragedy took place at the city Dionysia, usually in the spring
- comedy happened a bit earlier in the year at a festival called Lanaya (late winter)
- **all of the eleven extant comedies were written by Aristophanes**
- tragic poets, with almost no exceptions, used myth rather than contemporary life as their theme
- by contrast, comic poets, made up their own plots, and they involved contemporary Athenian life
- **moreover, the comic hero is an ordinary person**
- in tragedy, you have the great heroes from myth:
  - Agamemnon, Menelaus, the great Athenian king Theseus, or the great pan-Hellenic hero Heracles
- in standard comedy, the hero gets a great idea.
- he puts it into practice, overcomes opposition to it, and then enjoys the fruits of this wonderful idea.
- Dicaeopolis, means something like citizen of the just city
- His bright idea is to form a private peace with Sparta after he learns from Persian ambassadors that they will not be getting any money from them
- we hear of the privations Athenians are suffering from being enclosed in the walls rather than on their farms they enjoy so much
- the Archanians are the opposition, represented by the chorus
  - these are men who live in a rural deme, Acharny in the northwest part of Attica
  - both farmers and have a specialty, which is charcoal burning, so they make charcoal
  - they are rock ribbed Athenian patriots
    - they talk about what it was like to fight at Marathon
    - Oak-ripped Hoplites, defending the fatherland and now you have somebody trying to make a private peace with Sparta
- Dicaeopolis, takes a hostage, namely a bucket of coal, which is absurd, but the Archanians concede
- He says look, I hate the Spartans just like you hate them. It is not entirely their fault.
- This is happening as much because of the leaders that we trusted, we have to take things back into our own hands.
- Then as the comedy unfolds, we get another piece of vivid, immediate, topical humor
- Dicaeopolis starts to enjoy the fruits of his private peace, he has a little feast going, and there appears a Megarian farmer
- Remember the Megarians had been put under this Megarian decree
- Megarean hunger came to be used as a sort of euphemism for starvation
  - since they were cutoff from commerce
- The Megarian shows up with a basket of his own daughters in piglet costumes
  - wants to trade for basic foods, garlic and salt
- this is comedy, because under the surface, it was horrifying
  - since this is old comedy, the term piglet is a slang term for female genitals
- How comedy works:
  - don't look to closely because you will be moved from laughing to tears
- Aristophanes detested Cleon
- To be singled out by Aristophanes for ridicule is in its own way a mark of honor
- Aristophanes is a genius
- The comedy ends with Dicaeopolis happily drunk, enjoying his private peace
- The Athenians awarded the Acharnians first prize
- They laughed, enjoyed ridicule of Cleon, and then the next year elected Cleon general
- This is a necessary pause, because Thucydides doesn't give us much sense of how, ordinary Athenians were responding.
- Aristophanes shows us how there wasn't complete unity with war with Sparta

## Week 6 / Lecture 5: War Resumes: The Conquest of Melos (416)

- peace of Niceus of 421 was greeted with general rejoicing, although factions on both sides wanted to continue the war
- Thucydides argues that the Peloponnesian War lasted 27 years, from 431 to 404
- On the Spartan side, two ephores had tried to get Corinth to ally with Thebes against Athens
- On Athens' side, elected Strategis or General, Alcibiades, got the Peloponnesian states of Elis and Mantineia to ally with Athens

![war resumes](./images/war-resumes.png)

- 2 years later, in 418, the Spartans met the combined forces of the Elians and the Mantineians and the Argives at Magnia and the Spartans won a decisive victory
- As a result, Alcibides almost got ostracized
- the situation is getting tenser and tenser
- In 416, the Athenians go to the small island of Milos, way to the south. They demand that the Milians join the Athenian Confederacy as tribute paying subordinate Allies.
  - they were hit with tribute back in the 420s, but we don't know if they paid it. Now, Athens is clamping down
- Milians were settled from Sparta and have remained neutral in the war so far
- In 420s, the Athenians had killed the adult males and sold the women and children of a territory called Cione, up in the north.
- Thucydides has crafted for us a dialog about the nature of power.
- These were fiction, he was making this up.
- **This passage is so important: <u>The Melian Dialogue</u>**
  - This is still studied in international relations courses, in courses of philosophy and politics of ethics and the like
  - it involves many of the important sophistic teachings, that is, the relation between law and nature, between justice and expediency, between word and action.
- The Melians decide to resist. The Athenians come back with a fleet, kill the males and sell the women and children into slavery. They re-settle the island with 500 colonists from Athens.

- Why does Thucydides give this episode such prominence?
  - I think initially our sentiment is likely to be entirely on the side of the Mileans, underdogs, resisting against a much greater power.
  - We felt this way before when the Persians were bearing down on the Greeks.
  - Now the Athenians are playing the role of the aggressor.
  - If this were Herodotus, we might see this as an example of Athenian hubris, the overweening power, and arrogance, and violence.
  - A more consistent way with Thucydides' understanding of how history works, this is an example of a principle that he's articulated before, which is when war goes on long enough in a condition where, as we have already seen, the pre-existing rules of war have been suspended, they don't exist any more. Then there's no place that's safe. Not even a small island that's neutral, out of the way, like Milos.
  - Another grim understanding is that in Thucydides' understanding of the relation between speech and action, who's right?
    - Unmistakebly, the Athenians. Their logic, their argument is airtight.
    - The Melians generally don't stand a chance and to pin their hopes on chance signals to us that they are going to get crushed.
    - In a sophistic understanding, a perfect conjunction of word and action on the part of the Athenians.
      - They say what they're going to do.
      - They have the ability to do it, and they go ahead and do it.
  - The Athenians clarity and resolve is ice cold.
  - Behind it is Alcibiades, we'll talk about him more in the next few lectures.
- What happens next, which is the Athenian attack on a much larger island much farther away in Sicily, where Alcibiades played a central role
