# Lecture 1: Pronouncing Classical Latin

The liberal arts and a liberal education are reserved for those in free societies as there is not much point to teaching slaves to think for themselves, their masters do it for them.

Those that think Latin is dead do not know what they are missing.

The letters and sounds that make up the Roman Alphabet:

- adapted a West Greek alphabet, the Greeks got their alphabet from Phoenicians (the coast of Lebanon) and semitic connections
- no new letters to learn, but will have to adjust some of the sounds for restored classical pronunciation
- we will only discuss letters that have sounds different than their pronunciation in English
- we discuss vowels since they are a mess and the letters:
  - C, G, I, V
- the great vowel shift that explains how English is different from other European vowel pronunciations
  - English is the problem, not Latin
- **Latin vowels are pure: they each have only two sounds:**
  - short a, like the uh in about: **ă: uh**
  - long a, like the ah in father: **ā: ah**
  - short e, like eh in get
  - long e, as in cake
  - short i, as in kin
  - long i, as in machine
  - short o, as in ought
  - long o, as in go
  - short u, as in book
  - long u, as in food
  - y = i = Polybius, y is used when pronouncing Greek
  - c = k, like the c in car, pronounced like k everytime in Latin
  - g = guh, always hard, like the g in game, Latin ex: gemma
  - i = y, a vowel but can be used to indicate the sound we use for the consonant **y**, like in the word yummy, Latin ex: iam = now, pronounced "yum"
  - **r** was never the hard American r, Latin ex: Romanus
  - **v** = w, take some getting used to
    - all the letters u, v, and w derived from v
  - **also a class of vowel sounds when two vowels are combined called <u>diphthongs</u>**
    - pronounce both vowels at the same time to produce a single sound that is a combo of both sounds
    - **ae**: a + e = i, the i sound in "ice"
    - **oe**: o + e = oi, as in oil
    - **au**: a + u = ow, ow sound in howl
    - **eu**: e + u = , like in eucalyptus
      - only appears in words deriving from Greek
- **If a word has two syllables, always accent the first syllable: CAEsar**
- If a word has three or more syllables: two choices.
  - The accent goes on second-to-last syllable if the vowel in second-to-last syllable is long or counts as long. A short vowel counts as long if it is followed by two or more consonants.
  - If the vowel in second-to-last syllable is short, then the accent falls on the third-to-last syllable.
- Latin has special terms for its numbering of syllables:
  - **Last syllable = ultima**
  - **Second to last = penult**
  - **Third to last = antepenult**
- Long mark: **macrons**
  - Romans did not use them, we put them in to help us
