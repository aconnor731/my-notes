# Week 7

## 7.1: Introduction to Tragedy

- Tragedy, an entirely new genre
- Previously genres including Epics and Homeric hymns
  - these used dactelic hexameter form
- Tragedy has its own constraints and possibilities than in Epic poetry
  - much shorter time frames
  - concentrate on this crux moment, tight focus in the story
  - tragedy usually is happening in the now, present
  - real people are on stage, acting as other people (this is new to us)
  - a sense of absolute make-believe, different than Epic
  - at the time, Greeks were inventing the genre of Tragedy
  - actors are all male and they portray male and female, they wear masks, their own persona is being covered up by the masks
  - come to be in the 6th century BCE in Athens
  - come to full fruition in the 5th century BCE
  - major threesome: Aeschylus, Eurypedes, and Sophocles
  - context for Tragedy is much different than Epic and Homeric hymns
    - not aristocratic or ritualistic hymns
    - Greeks attend an outdoor theater
    - Roman amphitheaters are more stone, Greek are less extravagant
  - would attend in honor of **Dionysus**, the patron god of theater
    - he was drawn out as being the focus, a festival in his honor
  - a whole group of us Greeks would go to watch this entertainment unfold before us
  - features we notice when arriving:
    - a plain stage with plain scenery on a screen behind it
    - always a door at the middle of the back of the stage
      - we are often wondering what is happening behind the door
    - large space between the stage and the first row would have the chorus who would move around
      - the chorus would engage with the actors on stage
      - the actors would also address the audience, "Can you believe what is happening on stage?!"
      - they work back and forth with the audience and the actors on stage
  - these actors are delivering lines to display the actors they are portraying
  - choral odes are important to help explain what is happening in the play
    - are sometimes are tricky to read
    - the people who wrote them assumed you had scene a lot of these plays
  - a few people are up on stage and something really intense is happening to them
  - the atmosphere of a tragedy is like a pressure cooker (if only we could find our way out)
    - centripetal, the actors are moving towards the middle and escape is not possible
  - back and forth dialogue is a main feature in Tragedy

## 7.2: Family Ties, Betrayals

- families are so close together it is borders suffocation
- Aeschylus' Agamemnon, a trilogy, the Oresteia
- starts with the house of Atreus, in Mycenae
  - we know Agamemnon is from Mycenae
  - this citadel is not completely architecturally sound
- Argos is the region including Mycenae
- the Oresteia will explain in detail Agamemnon's problems
- starts with Tantalus suffering for all of eternity
  - he committed a food crime by serving the gods the carved up bits of his son
  - the gods reconstructs Pelops, his son
- he tries to get a princess, Hippodamia
- Pelops beats the King's challenge of a chariot race
- Pelops wins Hippodamia, takes the kingdom, and renames it Peloponesia
- then he has children: Thyestes and Atreus (the oldest son)
- Atreus bears Menelaus and Agamemnon, Thyestes bears Aegisthus
- Thyestes challenges for the eldest inheritances and cheats
- Zeus intervenes and Pelops wins
- Atreus carves up Thyestes own son, and serves him his own son and Thyestes eats him
- Thyestes goes to Delphi to figure out how to get back at his own brother
- He gets drunk and has sex with his own daughter
- he leaves behind his own familial sword
- his daughter is pregnant with Aegisthus
- Atreus spots her, takes her in, and believes the child she produces is his own
- Atreus sends Agamemnon and Menelaus to Delphi to figure out what to do to find Thyestes
- they find and drag Thyestes back home
- Atreus takes his other son, Aegisthus, and orders him to kill Thyestes with his own sword
- Thyestes notes that it is his son
- Aegisthus reunites with his true father, Thyestes
- the reunited go back and kill Atreus
- Menelaus and Agamemnon are banished, where they meet Helen and Clytemnestra
- they go back and take back the kingdom
- Aegisthus is wading around in the background for his opportunity to strike
- horrible things happen to and because of this family: the Trojan war as one example

## 7.3: Introducing Agamemnon

- a tragic story
- signal beacons from Troy to Argos signals to Clytemnestra that her husband has conquered Troy
- she uses this to set up things to kills him
- upon reunion, they test their own wills, subterraneanly
- Agamemnon is an incredibly strong man, but not too clever
  - his prize from war time, Cassandra
  - he brings her right out in the open, not too clever
- Greeks thought it was just fine to have concubines, but not rub it in their face
- Clytemnestra and him have a long back and forth

## 7.4: Agamemnon Themes

- Odysseus and Penelope were very close
- This shows that closeness can create nastiness
- Agamemnon is outside the secrecy of his wife Clytemnestra with her secrecy with Aegisthus
- Meditations on medicine and drugs
  - the term "pharmacon" shows up in this double-valenced way of both poison and medicine
- drugs were normally mixed and shred in a bowl before they are delivered
- Cassandra treats the death of Clytemnestra like being consumed like a pill
- Agamemnon makes a lot of connection with themes of **purification**
  - Clytemnestra wants to bathe him upon his return only to kill him
  - something meant to cure or fix things has the undue effect of the opposite
- this is like a mirror of the relationship between Odysseus and Penelope

## 7.5: Ideas of Justice

- theme to really concentrate on: **justice**
- past generations have committed horrible crimes that require revenge, but this revenge provides its own consequences
- Greek concept of justice
- important the difference of Homer's take and Aesylchus' take
- he recommends the libation bearers even though they are not required
- important question: rectifying the house of Atreus without violating justice.
- important ancient concept: "miasma"
  - hugely important concept in this story
  - means "cloud of pollution"
  - accompanies the corpse after a violent death
  - who committed the crime would have this nastiness stuck to them and would be subject to retribution and murder
  - gives background to how they might think justice might take place
  - when bad things start happening to bad people
    - it means they have pollution
    - through their own fault or just happenstance
    - just and unjust retribution
  - connection to blood and the stench of it

## 7.6: Libation Bearers

- Tragedies came in groups of 3 in classical antiquity
  - only one of them has all three parts in place: the Oresteia
  - we are reading two: the first and last
  - the libation bearers is the middle
- Orestes takes action after being left in the sad state he is in at the end of the first play: Agamemnon
- new generation of Orestes and Elektra, stuck with a curse and nastiness
- there is a nasty curse that is stuck to this family
- Tragedies come in groups of three
  - a typical evening at the theater would have these three parts
- Clytamnaestra believes justice has been served and all is right
- She is wrong as Orestes comes back to murder her and Aegisthus
- Orestes returns to Argos and meets with Elektra to plot to kill them
- They hold a seance, or hang out at the grave of their dead father
- they pour over libations for him
- they pray to earthly powers, the large forces/powers that are percoluting under the earth and the earth itself
- from Hesiod, these powers were defeated by Zeus and buried underground
- humans, when they need extra help, they appeal to these powers where they otherwise couldn't receive help from the gods
- they pray to Agamemnon's shade
- they want permission to carry out these murders, and they get it
- they disguise themselves as foreigners and kill them, not before a long test, argument, explaining why it is right for them to be killed by him
- Orestes then drags her behind the door, springs the door open and we realize she is dead
- Orestes reappears and is very relieved it is all over
- But, he is wrong. A new set of gods appear, the Furies. Gods of justice out for blood.
  - In Hesiod Theogony, they have a connection with the severed genitals of the Sky that Cronus cut off
  - nasty things came out of this, like the Furies here, from the blood of the severed genitals
- they are like blood-scenting hounds
- they will pursue their criminal relentlessly
- punishment is fixed, and cannot be talked out of
- Orestes will turn to a new version of justice that we will see in the final chapter of the Oresteia

## 7.7: Intro to the Eumenides

- play starts with Orestes fixed to the omphalos at Delphi

- he has protection because of this, the Furies cannot get him

- from Hesiod's Theogony, the omphalos is the stone that Cronus had swallowed instead of Zeus

- ghost of Clytamnaestra is haunting him while the top people in the universe, Athena and Apollo, are keeping watch over the situation

- the ideas of justice are discussed

- then, we are transported to Athens in a court case with the Furies

- the jury is deadlocked, so Athena steps in and sides with Orestes

- the Furies are angry, so the Olympians figure out a way to please them by giving them a new home underneath the court and giving them an honorable procession into it

- if someone has blood on their hands, the idea in this time is that you will be punished

- a system that is based on contagion, contact, and blood

- thoroughly associated by Orestes to these chronic dieties

- **Chtonic** dieties are attached to the earth

  - in Hesiod, all the older order gods are chtonic, including Earth herself
  - pre-Zeus, pre-Olympian layers of divine powers are stuck in here
  - throughout the play, Aeschylus aligns these older order divinities to these chtonic dieties

- Olympian order of justice is not the older order of justice, with the older order of justice consists of contagion, contact, and blood. This was opposed to the idea of justice of the Olympians.

- ```
  Since you, a young god, would ride down my elder age,
  I must stay here and listen to how the trial goes,
  being yet uncertain to loose my anger on the state.
  --The Furies speaking, lines 731-33
  ```

  - the Furies represent the elder gods, speaking to the young and new divinities of the Olympians
  - they are reticent to adopt the Olympians' order of justice

- So like how Zeus pushed the older gods under the earth, Aeschylus push the Furies (older gods) under the earth, giving them a new temple where we will give them honor and worship.

  - not like Hesiod where they are stuffed and locked in a jail, Aeschylus finds a place in the new order for the old order gods to have a role

- old system of justice being enforced by the Furies had no way with dealing with the problems that showed up in Agamemnon's family

  - the house of Atreus was just stuck according to this older system of justice

- by the laws of justice, he had to avenge his father. But in order to do that, he knew that it was a terrible thing to do.

- the older order of justice closes in around itself

- the trial in Athens over sought by the Olympians introduce a new idea of justice 

  - parallels to justice today

## 7.8: Measuring Evil

- get inside the mind of the trial
- there are some strange twists and turns
- the Olympians are on the side of the new system, that is held in a courtroom
- the chtonic dieties, the Furies, are on the other side, appealing for the older system of justice
- a decision a leader has to make is not between to great good and bad things, they are between two good things or two bad things
- it is argued to determine if one murder was worse than the other: the wife murdering husband, or the son murdering the mother
- Apollo and the Furies are on opposite sides:
  - Apollo downplays the mother relationship
    - she is not that important, a mere vessel for the son
  - the connection between the mother and son is not so important
  - the Furies are arguing that blood relations are more important
    - a wife killing a husband is not that bad, there is no blood connection
    - whereas a son murdering a mother is worse since there is a blood connection

## 7.9: Historical Background
