# Improving Social Skills

## Foundations

"We always spend more time on the foundation, because **the foundation is everything.** If the foundation is solid, the house will be strong. If the foundation is crooked, the house will be flawed. It's the same thing with your life--if the foundation of your life is in solid things, you will be strong. If you set your foundation in crooked things, you will crumble."

## Setting Goals For Your Social Skills Journey

A good friend of his likes to ask me, "Where are you, and where are you going?"

He asks this because he believes **life is a journey.** The person you were yesterday is different than the person you will be tomorrow, because the person you were yesterday was not shaped by today's experiences. You will change as you go through life. It is inevitable.

But how you change is **up to you.**

That's why it's important to know where you are, and where you're going. When you don't, it's like trying to make a long journey without a map.

The journey may still be a long one, but you know **you will not give up**, because you are focused on your destination.

Don't worry too much about how you respond to each of the following questions. There are no right or wrong answers; the questions are only there to guide your thinking.

### Where are you?

- What are your social strengths?
  Social strengths are the positive elements you bring to relationships and social interactions. They can be social skills, but they don't have to be. Being loyal to your friends or having a genuine desire to get to know others both count as social strengths, even if they might not be social skills.
- What were/are some of the best relationships of your past and present like? What made those relationships so good? How did those relationships affect your life?
- How have you tried to improve your social skills in the past? Have those methods been successful? If so, what made them successful? If not, what would help you be more successful this time around?
- What are the current gaps in your social skills knowledge? What are the elements of social interaction that you don't understand, or that you struggle to do successfully?
- Why did you decide to start reading *Improve Your Social Skills*?

### Where are you going?

- What are the practical areas of social skills that you want to improve?
  Practical skills are the nuts-and-bolts of social interaction. It's stuff like making conversations flow smoothly, understanding how other people are feeling, and avoiding needless conflict.
- What are your "short term" goals for social skills?
  Some examples might be making a new friend, having a fun time at a social event, or deepening your relationship with a specific friend. These should be goals that you think you could accomplish in the next few weeks or months.
- What are your long term goals for social skills?
  Some examples might be having someone you consider a close friend or feeling completely comfortable in social situations.
- Who are the people who can accompany you on your social skills journey?
  These might be friends, family or mentors who can encourage you, act as a sounding board, and provide a safe place to practice your social skills.
- What is your motivation for embarking on this journey of social skills improvement? How can you help yourself stay motivated, even when the journey becomes hard?



**Return to these answers occasionally as I progress through this guide.**

**Take the time to ask yourself "Where am I, and where am I going?" every so often, and you will make sure that you keep growing in the right direction.**

Remember that even slow growth is growth.

**Learning social skills is a journey, not a race.**



### Overcoming Fear and Social Anxiety

To overcome your fear, understand the difference between **true fear** and **physical fear**.

**True Fear**: See a bear in a campsite.

**Physical Fear**: See a bear in a campsite in a movie.

**Social Anxiety = Physical Fear**

It is ok if you fail during a social interaction. **_It is ok._**

If you're talking with someone and say something incredibly awkward, what will happen? Well, you'll feel embarrassed. The other person might become upset, or they might laugh at you. But then you'll recover.

The conversation will move onto a different topic. The other person will forgive your awkwardness, and will soon forget it entirely. Worst case, you will try again in a new conversation with someone else.

No real harm is done. Nobody was mauled by a bear.

Social interaction is supposed to be fun, and failure is not a big deal.

**Failure is not a big deal.**

Exception is with someone you have a long-term relationship. You could cause lasting damage, but if you are making an effort to be sensitive to their feelings, that is unlikely to happen.

When you don't know someone well, there is no relationship to damage and therefore no real danger.

### Freedom From Fear

Next time you feel your anxiety peaking at the thought of a social interaction, remind yourself that it's only physical fear. Social interaction can't really hurt you (even if you make a mistake).

**You don't need to fear failure.**

**Be courageous.**



### Manipulation vs True Intimacy

#### The Danger of Manipulation

True fulfilling relationships are **ALWAYS built on mutual trust and respect.**

If you manipulate someone, you are disrespecting them, and will destroy their trust in you as soon as they find out. You might be able to get what you want in the short term by using manipulation and deceit, but in the long term **you will always be found out.**

**You will never get the true intimacy you're seeking with deceit.**

You don't need deceit or manipulation. *Improve Your Social Skills* is based on the philosophy that you don't need to change who you are to be liked or accepted.
