## Chapter 1: Computer Networks and the Internet

### Section 1.1: What is the Internet?
There are two main types of <u>packet switches</u>: **routers** and **link-layer switches**.
Both types forward packets to their ultimate destination.
Each ISP (Intertent Service Provider) is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links.
ISPs:
- can connect websites directly to the internet

End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run **protocols** that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.
**The IP protocol specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems.**  
The Internet's principal protocols are collectively known as **TCP**.  
**RFCs**: Requests For Comments  
#### 1.1.2 A Services Description
Importantly, Internet applications run on end systems - they do not run in the packet switches in the network core.
