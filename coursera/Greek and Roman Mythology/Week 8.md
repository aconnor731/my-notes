# Week 8

## 8.1: Introduction to Oedipus

- Eurypedes, Sophocles, and Aeschylus make up the three greats of ancient Athens
- Sophocles: Oedipus
- What makes up a Greek identity? Remember from the Odyssey with Odysseus.
  - he has to recover his name, his background, and where he is from
- Sophocles inverts all of this, turns it upside down
- p. 258 of the Odyssey, matches the story of Oedipus
  - son kills the father, mother marries the son, mother commits suicide
  - Oedipus is born from this
  - Homer doesn't go into depth
- Sophocles remakes this in a powerful way
- Oedipus is trying to figure out the identity of the murderer, also causing him to ask himself the same question
- Oedipus ripping out his own eyes and his mothers' suicide happen behind the door

## 8.2: Oedipus and Fate

- lots of riddles
- message is trying to be sent but is being sent in an oblique manner
- life doesn't always reveal its messages clearly
- good with the Sphinx' riddle but not other riddles in his life
- Oedipus turns a blind eye to what is to come, ending up blinding himself horrificly
- Oedipus' dislocation is tragic
- site at Delphi will show up in important ways
- it knows everything that is going to happen to him and is continuous throughout his life
- Oedipus should be humble at Delphi and he is anything but
- important theme: **fate**
- Is he to blame for what he endures or is it fate?
- It seems he does not bear any responsibility.
- He hears from the oracle early on that he will kill his father and marry his mother, and he immediately runs away
- He is intelligent for solving the Sphinx' riddle, and receives wealth, notoriety, and acclaim.
- As he is diligently staying away from what the oracle said would happen, he marries someone who is relatively the same age as his mother, and he kills someone of his father's age.
- He kills him by playing chicken on an ancient Roman highway
- Oedipus gets bonked on the head after the collision, and then murders everyone there. He is a little off.
- He is a very intelligent person. But the question of judgment is slightly different.
- These little suspicions around the people of the older generation...
- He repeatedly conditions his own life and success on the Delphic oracle being wrong, very sacrilegious.

## 8.3: Oedipus and Oracles

- he is a great solver of riddles, let's look at this in more depth
- however, he struggles with the messages coming back from Delphi
- he pays a terrible price for not being able to understand these messages
- Teiresias is Apollo's priest, and Oedipus is wrong for not listening to him
- Teiresias, doesn't want to tell him directly, but eventually gets boxed in and then says to Oedipus, "You are the pollution. You murdered the guy."
- Oedipus starts accusing nasty things upon Teiresias after this.
- Creon asks Oedipus, "Suppose you do not understand..."
  - Oedipus is incapable of confronting when he is either wrong or cannot find what is right.
- Oedipus realizes that he is the own to murder the King at the crossroads. He says here:
  - "A wandering of the soul I could run mad."
  - What the oracle has said is true.
- Oedipus wants the herdsman to confirm the lie that thieves killed the King.
- the herdsman is revealed to be the man who Oedipus was given to by the Corinthian and was raised by him
- the Corinthian herdsman reveals to Oedipus that he was given to him and was adopted
- then, Oedipus realizes he is the murderer of his own father, Lias, and has married his own mother
- he rips out his eyes and his mother commits suicide
- we are all left with limits with our knowledge. Now, Oedipus is forced to live with his limits as he refused to do so in the past.

## 8.4: The Land and Identity

- in teasing out his own identity, Oedipus, yes, has to reckon with his lineage, his background, with Jocasta and with Laius.
- he has to wrestle with these awful conclusions and wind up in a terrible state of awful suffering.
- as part of his story is unfolding, another one is also unfolding. This is what Greek identity is all about.
- you're not just your lineage, but also where you're from.
- Oedipus' story of where he's from is interesting and complex.

Relevant places to Oedipus' story:

![Oedipus location](./images/oedipus-location.png)

- Thebes:
  - a famous place
  - rich complex background
  - also plays out in Euripedes Baccae
- Corinth is much like Thebes
- Cithaeron is a wild, uncivilized place
- the main land that ties Oedipus is not Thebes or Corinth, that he thinks, but Cithaeron
- Cithaeron:
  - has important role in the beginning
  - Creon says to Oedipus "the clue is in the land"
  - Oedipus thinks he might belong there
- Laius cast Oedipus (when he was an infant) "forth upon a pathless hillside" -- Jocasta (720)
- "On Cithaeron's slopes in the twisting thickets you were found" -- Corinthian messenger (1027)
- Oedipus begins to honor Cithaeron as he claims to come from there
- Now, not only is his biological lineage compromised, the connection he has to the land he is from, Cithaeron, is compromised.
  - what land heroes are from is important to their story

## 8.5: Chthonic Identity

- Oedipus' story of Thebes is rooted in a family with close connections to the land.
- Cadmus, the founding family of Thebes.
  - he was on a journey from his ancestral background city of Venice.
  - arrives at Thebes and there's a serpent wrapped around a spring, threatening people who try to get there.
  - Cadmus, who is powerful and strong, slays the serpent and takes his teeth and throws them into the ground.
  - from these teeth sprout up out of the ground itself grand heroes that are armed. 
  - They have this massive battle, fight one another in this archetypal act of fratricide.
  - Five of them survive and they become the founding families of Thebes.
  - This is the story where the Thebans understand themselves to come from.
- **Universal Law 7: A deep connection to the land is a common human expression.**
  - there is an aristocratic aspect, 19<sup>th</sup> Floridian...
  - the land came to you, a rooted connection to the land
- in the story of the founding families of Thebes, there is a very strong connection to the ground itself
- this is called **Autochthony**: born from the land
  - Autochtonis births are common in ancient myth
  - someone has to pick you up out of the ground, misfiguring your feet or something
    - Achilles' heel
    - Jason, a famous Greek hero, lost a sandal
- We learn from Oedipus' story that his name means "swollen foot"
  - Oedipus = Oideo + pous
  - many reasons this is so:
    - father cuts through is poor infant tendons and binds them together at his ankles, so he has vulnerability there.
- further connection to this autochthonous background that's being hinted at in talking about Oedipus' own lameness of his feet.
- Creon, line 130 -- "The riddling Sphinx induced us to neglect mysterious crimes and rather seek solution of troubles at our feet."
  - Oedipus has trouble with his own feet and needs to figure that one out.
- Teiresias, prophet who has Apollo's own insight, line 417 -- "A deadly footed, double striking curse, from father and mother both, shall drive you forth..."
- Jocasta, line 718 -- "King Laius pierced his ankles by the hands of others cast him forth"
- Oedipus, line 802 -- "going on foot, I was encountered by a herald and a carriage with a man in it"
  - recounting his own version of the event when Laius is killed
  - he is on foot at the time, there is a connection there with Oedipus' rootedness in his foot-based identity
- Messenger, line 1033-35, as he tells Oedipus' own background -- "I loosed you; The tendons of your feet were pierced and fettered... So that from this you're called your present name."
- Each of these point to Oedipus' foot defect, autochnous birth, a pure connection to the land
- the poet shows that his own father trying to kill him through his misfiguring his feet is emblematic of his birth and potential rebirth
  - it could be emblematic in two ways, either:
    - of how his father tried to kill him, through misfiguring his feet
    - own connection to Citharaon, his own rebirth, a special connection, rootedness despite his father's attempts to put him lost on the hillside
- without his father's attempts, he would not have the opportunity for rebirth
- but now, Oedipus is from nowhere
  - he is literally from a trackless hillside
  - singleton born out of the earth
  - has no people
  - no linkage
- the only connection remains is his own autotchonous connection to Chithaeron
  - kind of a sad, pathetic quality to it
  - only connection is to this baron wasteland
- autochtnous birth always has this sense of removing someone from their geneology
  - the fantasy of not having any parents or lineage
  - a certain appeal, escapism from a complex, and rough family background
- his family connections are so bad to Oedipus that he turns his back on them and says his only connection is with Chithaeron
- we are stuck with connections with each other
  - only way Oedipus deals with this is through this form of escapism

## 8.6: Readings of Oedipus

- Oedipus gives us a wonderful opportunity to dip into our toolbox
- functionalist lense: myths are told to legitimize and authorize social norms in the culture that is telling the myths to themselves.
  - First, incest is bad
  - the role of Delphi
    - divine wisdom that comes from oracles should be heeded
    - Oedipus tries to answer the questions himself without consulting for guidance from the oracle
- Freudian lense: all of us are repellant to ourselves, our own primal desires that we repress
  - we have conflicting feelings of our parents
    - sometimes too strong, so we supress them
    - Oedipus (son) has competitiveness with the father and intimacy with mother
  - we live out these desires through Oedipus and eschew him
- Autochthony:
  - connection with Chithaeron
  - he is expressing a very old and stubborn idea about where humans come from
  - the idea that humans might just spring up from the Earth itself
  - it's hard to dismiss because:
    - it gets rid of the problem of wanderingness
    - allows a certain kind of escapism from the complexities that we have with genealogical descent
- structuralist might look at this story as a family that's oscillating between on the one hand, embracing the idea of genetic lineage and background in their family.
- On the other hand, talking about autochthonous birth from the land itself.
- Both are anchored in Oedipus' story.
- Neither are resolved or worked out in the story.
- the tension between the two creates a voltage, how a structuralist would describe the story.

## 8.7: Greek and Dionysian Ritual

- turning now to the Bacchae of Euripides, we're going to see another identity dissolve before our eyes.
- Dionysus has another name: Bacchus. Both are equally Greek.
- most Greek rituals happen out in the open, in crowds, in public
- Cithaeron will play another role
- ripping up animals with their bare heads and eating the meat raw, this is what Dionesians do
- turning on its head Greek sacrificial rights
- Dionysus is the god of wine
- if you start liking wine, you enter a completely different world
- wine is part of many religious ceremonies
- wine in extraordinary excess is characteristic of Dionysus and his worship
- not just drunk, but completely gone drunk
- overturning all of the other normal components of Greek ritual
- It is a consistent piece of the Greek pantheon
- commonly viewed with some kind of strange eyes
- he might be a foreign god, a newcomer, they wonder where he came from
- Dionysus is as old as all the other Greek gods
- he seems from the very beginning always suspect
- the person in the family who is always wondered if he is actually part of the family
- some themes in the Baccae by Euripides
  - some parallel to the Homeric hymns
  - reference Dionysus's birth
  - he'll be trying to secure his place in the Pantheon
  - establishing his rights and ensuring that humans perform those rights
- myths, again, are there to give a background story to what you and I typically do
- Thebes again shows up in the Bacchae as it did with Oedipus and the family of Cadmus
- Thebes shows up in Greek tragedies
  - especially a kind of image of the Athens that Athenians like to imagine:
    - the Athens of stability
    - of rationality
    - of clear-headedness
  - all these things show up in the drama set in Athens
- When the Athenians talk about a strange place, where things are a little bit odd. A little off kilter.
  - they often talk of Thebes
- Thebes represents to them a deep background and an important mythic rootedness in the past. One that is odd, strange, and weird.
- There is a strong background in Cadmus family of violence.
- Remember, Cadmus, was originally a Phoenician (from Oedipus)
  - because he is chasing his own sister, Europa
  - Europa's chasing after Zeus in the form of a bull
  - she falls in love with the bull and tries to make contact with the bull
  - Cadmus is on his way to try and find her when he runs into the serpent, kills it, and throws its teeth into the ground
  - the beings that sprout up from the teeth, the founding families of Thebes, all turn on each other and start to kill each other, a fratricidal violence shows up in Cadmus' family.
  - Then, Cadmus' Daughter, Ino, Semele, Actaeon, and Agave, each have a troubling story.
  - Semele, is a very famous story.
    - she is the mortal mother of Dionysus
    - so Dionysus is deeply connected with Thebes in his own family lineage
    - on one hand, he has a mortal mother
    - Semele is impregnated by Zeus and Hera tricks Zeus to show himself to Semele in his full glory.
    - Semele gives birth and is quickly **immolated** (to kill [an animal, for instance] as a religious sacrifice)
    - Zeus then snatches up the infant and Dionysus is then born from Zeus' own thigh, a kind of male womb taking over where a female womb started.
    - So Zeus gives birth to Dionysus a second time, and he joins the Pantheon but poor Semele is immolated.
    - In addition, the daughters of Autonoe (O-tow-know-way) and Ino
    - Autonoe, her son Actaeon, dies by being ripped apart by his own hunting dogs
    - Ino also dies by plunging into the sea with her son in her own arms when her husband turns in a frenzy and chases her down and tries to kill her.
  - There are awful things percolating in Cadmus' family.
  - Agave, who's story we're going to see in Euripedes Bacchae has a terrible version of things happen to her too.
  - Each of these installments shows us that Cadmus' family is infected with this kind of violence in a way that it's not quite like the house of Atreus where that violence is constantly turning in on itself and unable to heal itself. Instead it just seems that awful things, seemingly at random, continuously visit this poor family.
  - Each of them has a connection with this figure of Baccus or Dionysus, who's story we'll talk about next.

## 8.8: Bacchae Themes

- Euripedes tells us that Dionysus is angry
- his divinity is not being fully recognized
- Euripedes pushes the limits of tragedy by having Dionysus actually appear as a character on stage.
- Dionysus has a very earthy role, a physical character achieving physical manipulation through Pentheus
- Pentheus wants to bind Dionysus because he doesn't want him to get involved
- Instead, Dionysus binds a bull
- then, disillusion starts
- Pentheus is disturbed
- women are erratic on the hillside
- then, Dionysus starts his kind of mind control of Pentheus, gets inside his head
- convinces him it would be a good idea to change his gender and go blend in with the women
- he sets him on a tree and has him spy on the rights that he sees
- he goes from the spier to the spiee
- his mother spots him as a potential quarry for a Dionysian backoned revelry
- the women tear his head off, tear him up as a living sacrifice in the way Dionysus likes.
- Argovae, believes she has a lion
- Cadmus' family is then banished from Thebes by Dionysus
- multiple themes:
  - first of all, inscribed on the temple at Delphi a Greek adage: "Nothing too much."
    - don't do anything to too strong of a degree
    - Pentheus' resistance to Dionysus' worship is characterized here as too much
    - Dionysus, puts Pentheus, on a pedestal (in the tree), then his "revelers," and when they spot this quarry, they rip him apart
  - hunter and hunted
    - remember, Actaeon, Cadmus' son, was ripped apart by his own hunting dogs
    - Cadmus family has this theme regularly
    - his daughter Ino, was hunted down by her crazed husband like she is a quarry
    - Semele, is immolated like an animal sacrifice.
    - Pentheus is hunted down by his own mother, like he is a quarry, a beast
    - represents a kind of an anxiety of bringing down a large animal, killing it. Is this the right thing to do?
    - Cadmus family shows the hunt could conceivably be offensive.
- the disillusion of Pentheus' dismembered self in the face of the utter strength of the god, Dionysus, is important in this play.

## 8.9: Reading the Bacchae

- two of our tools in our toolbox: myth and ritual
- a god tells us how he likes to be worshiped
- we see the consequence of not worshiping that God.
- why do we eat the sacrifice raw? why do we drink so much?
- the story gives us a narrative that helps fill in the reasoning behind all these pieces.
- Myths are made up in order to give an explanation to rituals' behaviors whose normal, sensible qualities don't really seem apparent to us as we're doing them, so we make up a myth in order to try to explain what it is we view those kind of things.
- now a functionalist reading:
  - what kind of social or cultural norm is this myth upholding?
  - Dionysus' set of rituals is built on an upheaval of social structures.
  - gender bending with a woman being inserted into a ritual.
  - this mirrors an aspect of Dionysus rites where women are in control of the ritual
  - women have the most powerful role there
  - very much an inversion in antiquity
  - there is drinking in excess
  - eating raw meat
  - loss of control of reproduction. Orgies are for pleasure, not having to do with strict strictures of which women could have sex with which men.
  - in Hesiod's Theogony, we saw this was a great anxiety for Greek men
  - in Dionysus rites, the female powers of reproduction are let loose
    - these powers linked with erotic desire are let free, to run rampant
  - Pentheus' very palace collapses
  - so talking about a social order, we see this dramaticized in the play
  - the revolutionary power then of Dionysian ritual is strongly apparent.
  - But, that's one the one hand
  - lets look at the other side
  - remind ourselves that Tyresius and Cadmus are old and powerful men, basically representing an establishment kind of thinking.
  - when they endorse these rituals, then we think it is probably okay to do
  - it's hardly some revolutionary thing if these gray beards are saying this is good for us, good for the city, so we should do it.
  - Following god is a good thing. **This is a message they keep putting across.**
  - Another message built into these rights is to **jump on the bandwagon, follow the crowd.**
  - being out of step with everyone else is not a good idea
  - this is a sign of respect, to submit to your elders, the gods
  - look what happens when Pentheus doesn't, awful things occur to him
  - these features make us wonder to ourselves, well wait a minute, why is this Dionysian worship considered revolutionary when the whole point of the play is you should worship the Gods?
  - what kind of social norm is the Dionysian cult then upholding? Remember the functionalist approach:
    - suggestion professor makes:
      - his sense is that what is being endorsed here is the social norm of producing a space where it's okay to violate normal social practice
      - you produce a space where something convoluted is allowed to happen.
      - examples of this that are common in religious calendars across many different cultures:
        - in the Christian calendar, 40 days before lent, Mardi Gras, where strict Catholics will be enforced in a period of abstention from some kind of pleasures during those 40 days of lent will go overboard.
          - elders might not like it, but they don't intervene
          - it is okay to blow off some steam, only in this quarantined spot
    - with the Dionysian rites, it is hard to say that anything in Dionysus is anti-Olympian
    - sure he has these aspects that are a little odd or strange, just arriving on the scene, but those don't make him any different than the Homeric hymn to Demeter or the Homeric hymn to Apollo.
      - these Olympian Gods kind of just arrive and they have to find their place
      - Dionysus' tradition is inline with the other Olympian Gods' tradition
    - the larger point with Dionysian worship is that **you owe respect to the Gods. You resist the Olympians at your own peril.** Look at what happened to Pentheus.
      - hardly a revolutionary idea
    - another cautionary note is that with Dionysian worship you should be a little careful. Watch out, this authorized space in which norm can be violated, you should be a little bit on alert.
    - Because there is always going to be a next day and you will have to pay a price.
    - whether it's a hangover from too much wine or something much worse with the case of Agave (chased by her husband and plunging into the ocean with her child)
    - the story definitely underwrites for us the idea that yes, go ahead and blow off steam, but be a little bit careful when you're doing it.
  - pull back and look at the plays themselves:
    - these plays, tragedies, are being performed during the festivals of Dionysus
    - Dionysus is the patron God of these plays
    - in order to show proper respect with these tragic performances
    - so, it is hardly a manner of a few people thumbing their noses at authority, some crazed young ones going berserk or anything like that.
    - This is a performance set in a space of Dionysus, in the city of Athens, in order for us all to understand more fully our civic engagement and our proper kinds of ritual behaviors.
- So according to a functionalist reading:
  - despite the spaces in which it gets complex on the one hand, on the other hand, the larger message is worship the Olympian divinities.
  - They liked to get worshiped, show respect.
  - For your elders, show respect and the respect for the customs of the day.
  - So their functionalist message of showing proper respect for the divinities gets fully endorsed and underwrited through even this strange cousin of ours, Dionysus, who has always been a member of our family, we Olympians and has his own ways of doing this.
  - Functionalist message: **But even though, so his ways are different than ours, all of us demand your respect, human beings.**
