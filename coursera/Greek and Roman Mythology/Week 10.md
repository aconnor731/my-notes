# Week 10

## 10.1: The Afterlife and the Underworld

- Virgil's trip to the underworld has different function than Homer's

- In Homer's, Odysseus goes down to figure out what wrong he did and how to right it, by finding Tiresias

- this underworld is like a giant holding cell

- all the spirits would rather be alive, they are all in the same boat

- all are the same, none are getting punished when others aren't

- Virgil's underworld is quite different in this regard

  - carefully constructed by Virgil where ethical scores are settled
  - those that have done well in life, they have nice long periods of joyful and happy things that surround their eternity
  - for those that have had evil, they have awful afterlives, they're actually physically punished
  - very different kind of world than Homer's

- intervening traditions help Virgil construct the underworld

  - Roman theological ideas, their ideas about the gods
  - Pythagorean philosophy, example of this underworld shows up in book 10 of Plato's *Republic*, way back in classical Athens
    - not at all a normal belief at the time Plato is talking about it
  - after Virgil makes the underworld look like this, it becomes very popular in the west, and is adopted by Christian theology

- Virgil gets very specific about what happens

- Virgil is bringing his rationalizing brain to bear

- Homer was pretty foggy

- Virgil, we see a full architecture and ways of how everything works

- the underworld is easy to go down, but difficult to return. It is tricky

- Aeneas will have to figure it out

- The Sibyl tells him there is a way: by finding a very special piece of foliage, The Golden Bough

- James Joyd, Geroge Frazier decided to name a seminal work in the study of mythology, in the early 1900's, Golden Bough.

- After this, this image was firmly established, at least in contemporary study of mythology

- When the Sibyl announces it to Virgil, she tells him he'll have to go and find this bough. It is there, and Sibyl tells him that it will come willingly and easily if you are called by fate (line 215). But, if you're not called by fate, there's no way you could rip it off, no matter how strong you are.

- lines 295 and following:

  ```
  So bright amid the dark leaves green ilex shown
  The golden leafage, rustling in light wind.
  Aeneas at once briskly took hold of it
  And, though it clung, greedily broke it off.
  Then carried to the Sibyl's cave (p. 167).
  ```

- though it clung, Aeneas took hold of it and though it clung greedily, it broke off

- Virgil spells out what seems to be a pretty clear middle way between the two distinctive and mutually exclusive possibilities that the Sibyl gave us.

- it doesn't fall off in Aeneas' hand and he's not foiled in his attempt to yank the thing off.

- this is a great example of Virgil finding the middle option of two thought to be the only options.

- He doesn't go back to explain himself, he leaves it in to leave an incrongruity, shadows in his texts, blank spaces that don't seem like they make sense according to the parameters that he himself set up.

- We saw this in the case of the marriage of Dido and Aeneas

- So, was Aeneas supposed to pull that bough off? Was it fated? Well, we don't really know.

- Underworld gods talked about:

  - Hecate, Night, Earth, and Proserpina: Roman name for Persephone

- we are moving down with Aeneas and the Sibyl

- Virgil gives a very elaborate and detailed architecture

- we scary things that are happening, but Virgil reassures us on line 400 that these are empty monsters, so we shouldn't be scared of them.

  - in the underworld, there is no substance, so things cannot hurt you
  - Virgil's scientific mind's perspective

- then, we are on our way to cross over the River Styx and move into limbo and other stages of the underworld.

- on our way, we run into a man, Palinurus, the steerhead who died earlier on Aeneas' ship, without them knowing.

- very much parallel to Elpenor in the Odyssey, he goes to underworld and Elpenor tells him to bury him

- this is where Virgil's story forks: Palinurus is not fulfilling the full story. The Sibyl tells Aeneas that he will be buried by the locals and we need to carry on through the underworld

- A typical Virgilian spin here: takes one character of Elpenor and splits him into two, both Misenus and Palinurus

- we get across the River Styx on Charon's boat, where it creaks upon Aeneas' weight, another rationalization as the boat normally carries weightless shadows

- Cerberus guards the underworld, we toss him a cake, that keeps him quiet and lets us get across.

- Then, we enter into the realm of Limbo: the place for the untimely dead

  - infants, those who have been unjustly condemned, suicides, those who died for love, and we meet Dido there
  - people didn't do wrong who are here, it's just that they died in a way that the circumstances did not allow them to experience the full pleasure, that's possible in an afterlife, and we're going to see what that is

- it's a sad place, not a good place to be

- we judges operating there, Minos making judgement on souls and sending them one direction or another

- as we make our way down, we see a whole mix of people who are mixed up in nasty stuff.

- eventually we get down to Tartarus, where all the worst sinners are

- Aeneas is curious and wants to check it out but Sibyl says no, it is far too terrible to see, too nasty

- Rhadamanthus acts as judge down there and awful things get dealt with in awful ways

- Sibyl then describes it

- page 178, "Dawn crosses the meridian." What does that mean?

  - She describes night arrives Aeneas, we are in a topsy-turvy world
  - Brueghel representation, very descriptive and disturbing: "Aeneas and the Sibyl in the Unerworld, 1630s. Brueghel, Jan the Younger"

- we move away into a different kind of world, one that is brighter and kinder

## 10.2: Themes in the Underworld

- Virgil is explaining through Anchises in the underworld the workings of the cosmos, incorporating many historical works like Plato's Republic and Cicero's Dream of Scipio
- Apocalypse literature was arising out of the eastern world
  - APO + KALYPSO = un-veiling, revealing, in Greek
- Anchises' Revelation telling how the cosmos is structured and works
  - starting with a scientific approach, the planets and such
- Anchises' gets to Augustus, moving from scientific and cosmic understanding to a historical one
- At the end, he says Augustus outperformed Alcides (Heracles)
- Rome's Identity (p. 190)
  - from Anchises: "To make the world work right."
- We exit, after this statement on Roman Identity, out of the gate of false dreams.
  - What does this mean?
  - Typical of Virgil, start with a sense of assurity, and end with uncertainty

## 10.3: Vergil and Theories of Myth

- Vergil was writing as a person who was fully engaged in myth in his time
- he built his myth with reference to theories of myth
- Ancient Ideas on Myth:
  - Rationalization
    - gods coming through the form of dreams
    - love being sent down to him through a divine sense
  - Allegory:
    - Juno/Hera: Greek 'ERA = AER' (air)
    - Jupiter/Zeus = Aether
    - lopas' song and poetry as science
  - Vergil as Proto-Functionalist
    - Remember, functionalists argue myths legitimize social customs
    - functionalism was not invented at the time, but he was aware of the power of this
- Vergil and Modern Ideas on Myth:
  - `pietas` won over `xenia`
    - hospitality is well and good, but duty is more important
- duty is even better than xenia
- from a functionalist perspective: the idea of `pietas` was explicitly intended to collide with the Greek idea of `xenia`
- Freudian tool: **myths are dreams for an entire culture**
- structuralist perspective: look at the binary aspects of the myth, the tension between the two create the voltage of the myth
- voluntary associations versus blood relations, Oresteia show voluntary associations were better than blood relations
- going to Rome, we are going back to blood relations being better, back to the future
- Aeneas, connection to his father and son, Anchises and Anchias
- Aeneas voluntarily associates with Dido and voluntarily leaves her
- Anchises shows all the important lineages
- these two binaries come in conflict with one another

## 10.4: Ovid--Background and Themes

- episodic in nature, can't keep his focus on any one particular thing
- more playful kind of poetry
- 43 BCE - 17 CE
- a lot of internal conflicts
- torn between two courses of action, usually passion on the one hand and duty on the other hand
- With Virgil, duty usually wins
- In Ovid, it is the other way around
- regular people involved in great events
- watching from the edges, zooming in and out
- world is based on change, atoms come together to form one shape, then fall apart to reorganize
- Ovid was from very wealthy family
  - best education money could buy: a training in the verbal arts
  - could be a lawyer, but tells his parents he wants to be a poet
  - the thought of being a wealthy senator
- indisputed greatest poet of his day, the time after Virgil
- critics had mixed feelings:
  - Quintillian, a literary critic: "he could have been better if he had control his genius rather than let it control him"
  - kind of like Mozart, in the movie Amadeus, sometimes his genius can create issues
- got in trouble with the law, he has to live his life in exile in a far off city, Tomis
  - he was a very urbane individual, and couldn't live in arguably the greatest city of all time
- we defined myth at the beginning of the course: **a traditional tale with secondary partial reference to something of collective importance, told by someone, for some reason**
  - Walter Burkhardt, the great scholar of Greek myth came up with it (the professor added "told by someone, for some reason")
- for Ovid, a different definition of myth: **a clump of stories, probably untrue, about ancient characters, that may have or may not have existed, but some deeper truths in them or not, but they are surely fun to hear**
  - resembles how we understand myth today, looking at Hollywood, and out entertainment industry
- Ovid looks at entire history
- his particular definition, is usually the one that wins out
- if you see someone re-interpreting a myth, it is probably Ovid's rendition
- he becomes so authoratative, due to his encyclopedic nature and his incredibly playful spirit and virtuosity in his poetic technique
- Ovid will present to us **a coherent group of old tales**
  - coherent insofar as it holds together, but it jumps around
  - he is bored by focusing on one thing, he jumps around
- tale of Orestes, Aeneas and the founding of Rome, Odysseus, Ovid tries to do the whole thing, all together
  - with him, we start to see something more than just myths, but mythology: the large collection of things, a study of itself
- **themes**:
  - **change and transformation**
    - in Thebes, the snake fangs sprouting up families
  - **line between human and animal**
    - Agave, mistakes her own son for a sacrificial animal and slices off his own head
    - when that line gets crossed, violence usually follows
    - although he is playful, there are serious consequences
  - theme 2: **illicit love and passion** 
    - lots of rape: "The rape of the Sabine women"
      - the idea of rape in Ovid's tale, he presents it in a way that shows a certain kind of tittilation, excitement, transgressions that happens. The violent outcome of these transgressions will be exhibited too
      - someone turning into a flower seems like a charming story and a human women turned into an animal due to a rape
        - in both cases, violence is close by the surface, and Ovid wants to pull it out for us
  - theme 3: **strong links between the divine and human world**
    - example, Diana is spotted. When you spot a god, run away!
      - danger is waiting
  - Ovid is like Prometheus, he is stealing fire from the gods and there is pain and suffering to follow for him
  - theme 4: **bodies**
    - Ovid is very interested in the corporeal, physical nature of you and I as human beings
    - we see their fragility, their changeability
    - humans are anchored to them, sadly
    - and we see them in a way that humans tend to resist, a way that the wider world looks at them
    - when a predator looks at us, we look like a piece of meat, not someone we would like to get to know
    - flesh is fragile, maybe prey for some other animal

- **"RAGE" - The Iliad, heroic epic**
  - **the first words were a war rage**
- **"MAN" - The Odyssey, heroic epic**
  - **the first words are about "a man"**
- **"Arms and a man" - The Aeneid**
  - **the first words, Vergil tells us he will sing about both**
- **"Forms changed into new and different bodies" - The Metamorphoses**
  - **opening Latin: "In nova..." (in noah)**
    - **a prepositional phrase, not a noun you can easily jump onto**
  - **for Ovid, he jumps in in a way that slightly bends the traditional formulation**
- The Metamorphoses will focus on moments of destruction, change is going to happen, but these moments will not be gentle, they will be violent, with pain and suffering
- the metamorphosis, any individual change that is talked about, it could be punishment, a form of justice, more often, **it is just a random visitation**
  - someone just happened to step into a situation and before you know it, they are changed into something else
  - judgment that is visited on this person may or may not have deserved it, it is not a world that is ruled by some overarching theme of justice
- bodies are victims in the Metamorphoses:
  - they are porous, wounded, dismembered, dissolved
  - they are turned into a thing instead of a human being
- stories we have already seen: Acteon and Pentheus
  - Ovid likes to focus on these, traditional tales of humans getting ripped up
  - with the case of Narcissus, we will seen with this version of it, how it puts different spins on it that you may not have seen before
    - body just kind of wastes away, disappears
- humans will change into plants or animals, always that change, is accompanied by some kind of destructive possibility
- understanding Ovid's focus of bodies:
  - Ovid's time is in an imperial age
  - of high spectacle, the coliseum is up and running
    - human bodies are put on display, are being ripped up by other animals
      - we are seeing the fragile, porous nature of human bodies in the form of entertainments
      - **Ovid is putting us inside that world**
        - it may well be that is own approach is influenced by a certain carelessness to the human form in the world around him

## 10.5: Re-visiting Thebes

- remember the dissolving self in Thebes
- highly learned and elusive poet
- he writes for a highly literate audience, he assumes you know the important background
- remember the tale, Cadmus encounters the dragon, serpent, and slays him
- he takes the teeth and tosses them into the ground
- then, people pop up from plants
- we will see the excitement of the plants becoming human
- We will see Actaeon, Semele, Teiresias, Narcissus, and Pentheus
- Actaeon, catches a glimpse of Diana
- there is a very strong sense of intimacy in this scene, she is in the bathroom, putting makeup on herself, grooming her.
- we are not supposed to see this of strangers and certainly not godesses
- Ovid's alluding in allowing in his presentation of the scene, allowing us to be like Pentheus
- he is inviting us to commit the same crime that Actaeon does, looking with ogooling eyes
- what is she doing over there? We get pulled in
- When Diana reacts to what's happening, she is embarrassed. She blushes.
- Imagine a divinity blushing, that is crazy!
- then, all hell breaks loose.
- Actaeon gets chewed up by his own dogs and turned into an animal
- we hear a story of Semele:
  - Juno is prodding her and trying to get her to doubt that it was Zeus who she was with.
  - this is Semele's undoing, Juno plants a seed of doubt and asks Zeus to reveal himself and then she is immolated
- with both Actaeon and Diana, and Semele and Juno, **the line between human and divine is psychologized**
- with Actaeon, Diana is embarrassed. In the case of Juno, it is doubt and jealousy.
- We here of Teiresias' long story, we get inside his head mainly to get inside the tale of Narcissus
- Teiresias knows all kinds of things
- how does he know this? Well, he uniquely, has been able to experience sex as both a man and a woman
- And because of this experiential dimension, he now has all knowledge, having both is multiplied with each other
- Juno is of course jealous, she is typically jealous, and she blinds Teiresias
  - she usually punishes humans by making them defective
- with Narcissus, things you might know:
  - where flowers come from
  - he gets transfixed with his reflection in a pond and turns into a flower
- this is kind of a kids version
- but Ovid, Teiresias tells Narcissus that he will be fine with what he sees as long as he never knows himself.
- When he looks, he sees an object
- then, he gets frozen
- Ovid packages it as an erotic love, which is completely misplaced.
- there is a further dimension to this story: what it means to be human.
  - it is strange to be self-aware, self-conscious subjectivity
  - it would be a little easier not to be one of those
    - if I were a puppy, food and going for a walk and I am satisfied
    - as a self-conscious human being, life is a little more complicated. Sometimes it is good, sometimes it is not so good.
- now, Narcissus understands himself as an object to other people
- that is a disturbing recognition. So his life ends there. He doesn't get out of the greased funnel of self-contemplation.
- Then we hear the story of Pentheus
- for Ovid, it is more a story of Pentheus versus Teiresias
- Another story of Bacchus and men not knowing they have a god in their midst
- stories talked about set in Theban fashion talks about close connection between human and divine, something goes terribly wrong, and that close connection is psychologized:
  - Actaeon:
    - Diana is embarassed
  - Semele
  - Teiresias
  - Echo and Narcissus:
    - Narcissus emotional attaction to himself is his undoing
  - Pentheus:
    - wanting to see what he ought not to
- these passions show that the human transgression vis a vis the divine, leads to some kind of problem that shows in a psychological manifestation and ends in a corporeal undoing: the human dissolved, is ripped up, torn.
  - see a glimpse of the divine world, stay away

## 10.6: Trojan War Again

- moving into a different kind of genre, from a Homeric epic, to a "mock epic"
- he is having fun with us
- if he goes off on a tangent, and you are unsure how this relates to the Trojan War, you are onto it
- Ovid's treatment of the Trojan War is very strange
- outline of the main action:
  - departure for Troy
  - we hear of Iphigenia, in Ovid's version, she is saved in the last minute: Diana substitutes a deer for her
  - then, we hear of Achilles, and incredibly effective and elegant killer
  - Achilles fights a not too important figure of Signus
  - Achilles is represented as a bull, a simile we have seen before
  - Achilles just uses brute force to kill Signus with his shield
  - then, we get to the battle of the Lapiths and the Centaurs
  - how did we get on to this topic?
    - Ovid has only a very tangential relation to this whole thing
    - it comes from old king Nestor, who, like many old people, likes to talk and here the sound of his own voice
  - how does Ovid tell this battle? He talks about Caeneus (Ki-Nay-Us), a man who was a woman once, and wish she could be turned into a man again to avoid being raped again, da da da da, Nestor is just prattling on
  - then all of a sudden, we hear of the hymn of the Lapiths, and how they killed the Centaurs
  - Nestor is just prattling on
  - we don't really care about Lapiths or the Centaurs who we care nothing about
    - Ovid uses this as way to show gruesomeness triumphing heroism
    - we normally care about the people who are getting ripped up, but with the Centaurs, we don't care at all
    - Centaurs, creatures that are both man and beast together
    - we don't have a great scene where people fight for what is right, it is just gory for gore's sake
  - we jump back to our digressive moment of Caeneus and we hear that he was there too
    - not much too do with the Trojan War
  - then, suddenly, we just hear about the death of Achilles
  - killed by a cheap shot from the peanut gallery
  - Paris, not respected as a great warrior, kills him with a bow and arrow

## 10.7: Battle for the Arms of Achilles

- after Achilles tragic death, their is now a hot debate, who gets the arms of Achilles? These great and magnificent arms
- so, Odysseus and Ajax verbally battle each other
- they don't talk about their own great qualities, they just point out the nasty qualities of the other
- in Ovid's version, we hear of the night raid Ulysses participated in
  - famously nasty bit of work Odysseus did in book 11 of the Iliad
- we hear also of how Ulysses faked madness to dodge the draft, which was true, tried to avoid going to Troy by faking madness
- we hear of Philoctetes, who has a nasty condition, so Ulysses convinces the crew to just maroon him on an island
  - Ulysses was the one who spearheaded this nasty business
- he is a crafty talker and a liar, Ajax says
- he is parasitical on the great fighter of Diomedes who does a lot of the hard fighter
- then Odysseus jumps in, diffuses the claim that he is a crafty talker, and don't hold Ajax' own stupidity against him
- we have a flattering opening, particularly flattering Agamemnon, as a good rhetorician, he makes sure his audience likes him
- then he recounts his many victories and successes and of how stupid Ajax is
- **there is a victory of chattering over heroism**
  - they are on the same side, aspect of civil war
  - Ovid is taking the glorious moments of this story and showing the inglorious ones
- this story is not always negative, Ovid did this
- the education system at the time of Ovid:
  - Ovid had great training to be a good spokesman
  - wonderfully skilled in the verbal arts, a way for him to get ahead in his time, like lawyers do
  - one of the ways, standard ways, that people practiced in their education system in ancient Rome, was to take set pieces from ancient mythology, then produce them up on stage for their peers
  - the set pieces they would take would be where one character from mythology would argue with another, in a nasty back and forth at each other, hurling insults
  - he knew this as an exercise as a schoolboy, he presents mythic poetry as a schoolboy exercise, mocking what his teachers taught him
    - wonderfully, subtle, satirical

## 10.8: The Fall of Troy and the Founding of Rome

- in the closing parts of Ovid's account of the fall of Troy, we see the sufferings of Hecuba and her children, famous threads in the yarn around Troy
- it is not as though the tradition ignores them, but Ovid seems to pay special attention to embrace them
- he has taken the heroism of the story of Troy and recasts them as nasty arguments, the heroism gets drained out of them
- in these moments, Ovid almost embraces these greedily
- the figure of Hecuba and her suffering:
  - matriarchal aspect
  - under great loss she maintains her dignity with a decimated family
- we jump into the story of the Aeneid pretty seemlessly
- we get him out of Troy
- we go through Delos, Crete, Scylla, and Charibdus pretty quickly
- then, there is a long digression, almost 10 pages:
  - we hear about Galataea and Accus, happy lovers, but the Cyclops loves Galatea
  - Ovid is giving a long digression of the softer side of the Cyclops
    - kind of comical
    - it's quite funny, absurd, for the Cyclops have a gentle side
- then we hear about the Scylla and how she got that way
  - makes us kind of feel tender to the Scylla
- **there is a soft side to these monsters, and a monstrous side to the people we admire**
- we hear of Dido and the Sybil, then another long digression:
  - Greek tales of Achamenides, Polyphemus, Aelos, Circe
  - remember, we are supposed to be talking about the Aeneid, Aeneas, and the founding of Rome
  - Ovid avoids direct confrontation with Vergil, but there are strong, obvious contrasts with Vergil:
    - lack of teleogical thrust, things are much the opposite that they are moving towards a particular, purposeful end, instead they are pushed off to a digression
  - we have a predictable emphasis on the sourceross Circe and the prophetess the Sybil
  - Ovid likes these two, they are shapeshifters
  - there is a lack of prophecy for Aeneas, but there is one at the end of the story, but it doesn't figure into these stories of battles
  - what kind of Rome is Ovid imagining?
    - we got order on the one hand, with beautiful Roman structures, and disorder on the other hand
    - in Ovid's world, the world is struggling between this disorder and order
    - disorder, in the end, kind of seems to win
      - anything that seems stable is always about to change, disorder upends it
    - internal conflict: passion versus duty where passion works out
    - close look at everyday life, small people in the middle of grand circumstances
    - we've got this fumbling march toward some kind of an endpoint, we have no idea what it is
    - in the end, Ovid tells us, it is indeed Rome and it is indeed Augustus, not tongue in cheek
    - Ovid, tells us that even the Great Roman Empire might have some cracks
    - probably why he was exiled by Augustus

## 10.9: Conclusion

- these stories of humans aren't just out there in the aether
- they are constructed and dispensed for a reason
- these stories are great to hear, his goal was to give me a chance, excuse, an encouragement to hang out with people much smarter than he is: Homer, Hesiod, Vergil, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Ovid
-
