# Chapter 19: Protective Covenants

### Prohibition of Prior Liens.

### Equal-and-ratable Security Clause.

When a bond issue is unsecured it is almost always provided that it will share equally in any mortgage lien later placed on the property.

### Purchase-money Mortgages.

*Purchase-money-mortgages*: liens attaching only to new property subsequently acquired, and their assumption is not regarded as affecting the position of the other bondholders.

### Subordination of Bond Issues to Bank Debt in Reorganization.

### Safeguards against Creation of Additional Amounts of the Same Issue.

Nearly all bonds or preferred issues enjoy adequate safeguards in the respect to the creation of additional amounts of the issue.

- customary provisions require a substantial margin of earnings above the requirements of the issue as thus enlarged.
- examples include only the issuance of new bonds if the earnings were above a certain factor increase

- these provisions are practically nonexistent in the railroad field, although their provisions address new issuance so that the total funded indebtedness does not exceed a certain ratio to the capital stock outstanding

**In the typical case additional issues of mortgage bonds may be made only against pledge of new property worth considerably more than the increase in debt.**

### Working-capital Requirements.

Really no standard provisions for maintaining working capital at a certain percentage of bonded debt, and for a certain ratio of current assets to current liabilities.

Some examples:

- prohibiting dividends unless net current assets equal 150% of the outstanding bond issue

**It is suggested that an adequate ratio of <u>net current assets</u> to <u>funded debt</u> be considered as one of the specific criteria in the selection of industrial bonds.**

### Voting Control as a Remedy.

### Protective Provisions for Investment-trust Issues.

**The more usual figures for the required ratio of net assets to funded debt are 125 or 150%.**

- also applies to receiving cash dividends

## Sinking Funds

In its modern form a sinking fund **provides for the periodic retirement of a certain portion of a senior issue through payments made by the corporation.**

### Benefits.

Twofold in nature:

- the continuous reduction in the size of the issue makes for increasing safety and the easier repayment of the balance at maturity
- the support given to the market for the issue through the repeated appearance of a substantial buying demand.

### Indispensable in Some Cases.

Adequate sinking funds might be able to retire entire issues out of the earnings which were distributed to the stockholders.

### Serial Maturities as an Alternative.

Serial maturities are also frequently employed in state and municipal financing.

### Problems of Enforcement.

The success of a bond investment depends primarily upon the success of the enterprise and only to a very secondary degree upon the terms of the indenture.

**Hence the seeming paradox that the senior securities that have fared best in the depression have on the whole quite unsatisfactory indenture or charter provisions.**

The explanation is that the **best issues as a class have been the oldest issues, and these date from times when less attention was paid than now to protective covenants.**

While the protective covenants we have been discussing do not *guarantee* the safety of the issue, they nevertheless *add* to the safety and are therefore worth insisting upon.
