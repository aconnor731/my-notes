# Chapter 21: Supervision of Investment Holdings

### Traditional Concept of "Permanent Investment."

A generation ago a sound investment was by definition one that could be bought, put away, and forgotten except on coupon or dividend dates.

Then, in the period of time before the 1929 crash, a new principle was followed, summed up by the dictum, "There are no permanent investments."

### Periodic Inspection of Holdings Necessary--but Troublesome.

### Superiority of United States Savings Bonds.

For all people of moderate means United States Savings Bonds undoubtedly offer the most suitable medium for fixed-value investment.

We are convinced that the public generally will derive far better results from fixed-value investments, if selected with exceeding care, than from speculative operations, even though these may be aided by considerable education in financial matters.

Principles and practical methods to follow for periodic reexamination of investment holdings:

### Principles and Problems of Systematic Supervision; Switching.

If the soundness has become questionable upon reexamination, the investor should exchange it for a better one.

In making such a "switch" the investor must be prepared to accept a moderate loss on the holding he sells out, which loss he must charge against his aggregate investment income.

### Exceptional Margins of Safety as Insurance against Doubt.

The degree of safety enjoyed by the issue, as shown by quantitative measures, must be so far in *excess* of the minimum standards that a large shrinkage can be suffered before its position need be called into question.

### Policy in Depression.

The investor should not be stampeded into selling out holdings with a strong past record because of a current decline in earnings.

- he should consider carefully considered switches.

### Sources of Investment Advice and Supervision.

Choices to the investor:

1. The investor himself
2. His commercial bank.
3. An investment banking (or underwriting) house.
   1. not impartial if they are selling their own securities.
4. A New York Stock Exchange firm.
   1. much more likely to be impartial than investment banking houses because they do not ordinarily own securities for sale
5. The advisory department of a large trust company.
6. Independent investment counsel or supervisory service.
   1. gives advice on a fee basis
   2. can be entirely impartial, having no interest in the sale of any securities or in any commission on their client's transactions.
   3. cost is high though

The last two charge fees.

**Much as the investor would like to be able to buy at just the right time and to sell out when prices are about to fall, experience shows that he is not likely to be brilliantly successful in such efforts and that by injecting the trading element into his investment operations he will disrupt the income return on his capital and inevitably shift his interest into speculative directions.**
