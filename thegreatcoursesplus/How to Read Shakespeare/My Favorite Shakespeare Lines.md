# My Favorite Shakespeare Lines

"This we prescribe, though no physician;
Deep malice makes too deep incision." - *King Richard II, Twelfth Night, Act 1 Scene 1, lines 154-155*

"Lions make leopards tame." - *King Richard II, Twelfth Night, Act 1 Scene 1, lines 174*

"Truth hath a quiet breast." - *Mowbray, Act 1 Scene 3, line 96*

"Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour." - *Gaunt, Act 1 Scene 3, line 230*

"Base men by his endowments *(property)* are made great." - *Willoughby, Act 2 Scene 3, line 138*

"My lord, wise men ne'er wail their present woes,
But presently prevent the ways to wail.
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe.
Fear and be slain--no worse can come to fight;
And fight and die is death destroying death,
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath." - *Carlisle, Act 3 Scene 2, lines 173-179*
