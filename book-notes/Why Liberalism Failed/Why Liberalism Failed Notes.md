# Why Liberalism Failed Notes

Ideology in politics fails for two reasons:

1. Because it is based on falsehood about human nature, and hence can't help but fail.
2. Because as those falsehoods become more evident, the gap grows between what the ideology claims and the lived experience of human beings under its domain until the regime loses legitimacy.

Liberalism is burdened by the miseries of its success.

At its inception, liberalism promised to displace an old aristocracy in the name of liberty; yet as it eliminates every vestige of an old order, the heirs of their hopeful anti-aristocratic forebears regard its replacement as a new, perhaps even more pernicious, kind of aristocracy.

Liberalism was premised upon the limitation of government and the liberation of the individual from arbitrary political control.

Our government readily complies, moving like a ratchet wrench, always in one direction, enlarging and expanding in response to civic grievances, ironically leading in turn to citizens' further experience of distance and powerlessness.

The belief that liberalism could achieve *modus vivendi* by encouraging privatism has culminated in the nearly complete disassociation of the governing class and a citizenry without a *cives*.

### Economics

Whether people want the world "reaching into" individuals, corporations, and nation states is not a matter for discussion, for the process cannot be stopped.

Globalism is inevitable.

### Education

The rising generation is indoctrinated to embrace an economic and political system they distinctly fear, filling them with cynicism toward their future and their participation in maintaining an order they cannot avoid but which they neither believe in nor trust.

Far from feeling themselves to constitute the most liberated and autonomous generation in history, young adults believe less in their task at hand than Sisyphus rolling the boulder up the mountainside.

From a student of the author's: "We are meritocrats out of a survivalist instinct. If we do not race to the very top, the only remaining option is a bottomless pit of failure. To simply work hard and get decent grades doesn't cut it anymore if you believe there are only two options: the very top or rock bottom. It is a classic prisoner's dilemma: to sit around for 2-3 hours at the dining hall 'shooting the breeze', or to spend time engaged in intellectual conversation in moral and philosophical issues, or to go on a date all detract from time we could be spending on getting to the top and, thus, will leave us worse off relative to everyone else....Because we view humanity-and thus its institutions-as corrupt and selfish, the only person we can rely upon is our self. The only way we can avoid failure, being let down, and ultimately succumbing to the chaotic world around us, therefore, is to have the means (financial security) to rely only upon ourselves."

At the moment of liberalism's culmination, then, we see the headlong evacuation of the liberal arts. The liberal arts were long understood to be the essential form of education for a free people, especially citizens who aspired to self-government.

### Science and Technology

As the farmer and author Wendell Berry has written, if modern science and technology were conceived as a "war against nature," then "it is a war in every sense-nature is fighting us as much as we are fighting it. And...it appears that we are losing."

Today we are accustomed to arguing that we should follow the science in an issue such as climate change, ignoring that our crisis is the result of long-standing triumphs of science and technology in which "following science" was tantamount to civilizational progress.

Our carbon-saturated world is the hangover of a 150-year party in which, until the very end, we believed we had achieved the dream of liberation from nature's constraints.

**We still hold the incoherent view that science can liberate us from limits while solving the attendant consequences of that project.**

What is supposed to allow us to transform our world is instead transforming us, making us into creatures to which many, if not most of us, have not given our "consent."

**It is making us ever more into the creatures that liberalism supposed was our nature in that "state of nature" that existed before the coming of civilization, law, and government.**

Our main political choices come down to which depersonalized mechanism will purportedly advance our freedom and security-the space of the market, which collects our billions upon billions of choices to provide for our wants and needs without demanding from us any specific thought or intention about the wants and needs of others; or the liberal state, which establishes depersonalized procedures and mechanisms for the wants and needs of others that remain insufficiently addressed by the market.

Thus the insistent demand that we choose between protection of individual liberty and expansion of state activity masks the true relation between the state and market: that they grow constantly and necessarily together. 

**Statism enables individualism, individualism demands statism.**

The most challenging step we must take is a rejection of the belief that the ailments of liberal society can be fixed by realizing liberalism.

Both main political options of our age must be understood as different sides of the same counterfeit coin.

Liberalism's appeal lies in its continuities with the **deepest commitments of the Western political tradition, particularly efforts to secure liberty and human dignity through the constraint of tyranny, arbitrary rule, and oppression.**

A rejection of the world's first and last remaining ideology does not entail its replacement with a new and doubtless not very different ideology. Political revolution to overturn a revolutionary order would produce only disorder and misery. **A better course will consist in smaller, local forms of resistance: practices more than theories, the building of resilient new cultures against the anticulture of liberalism.**

## Chapter 1: Unsustainable Liberalism

There were plausible grounds why, in 1989, Francis Fukuyama could declare that the long debate over ideal regimes had ended, and that liberalism was the end station of History.

Liberalism did not discover or invent the human longing for liberty: the word *libertas* is of ancient origin, and its defense and realization have been a primary goal from the first forays into political philosophy in ancient Greece and Rome.

The Roman and then medieval Christian philosophical traditions retained the Greek emphasis upon the cultivation of virtue as a central defense against tyranny, but also developed institutional forms that sought to check the power of leaders while (to varying degrees) opening routes to informal expression of popular opinion in political rule.

Protection of rights of individuals and the belief in inviolable human dignity, if not always consistently recognized and practiced, were nevertheless philosophical achievements of premodern medieval Europe.

It was Machiavelli who broke with the classical and Christian aspiration to temper tyrannical temptation through an education in virtue, scoring the premodern philosophic tradition as an unbroken series of unrealistic and unreliable fantasies of "imaginary republics and principalities that have never existed in practice and never could; **for the gap between how people actually behave and how they ought to behave is so great that anyone who ignores everyday reality in order to live up to an ideal will soon discover that he has been taught how to destroy himself, not how to preserve himself.**"

Fukuyama held that liberalism had proved itself the sole legitimate regime on the basis that it had withstood all challengers and defeated all competitors and further, that it *worked* because it accorded with human nature.

**The potency of this threat arises from the fundamental nature of liberalism, from what are thought to be its very strengths--especially its faith in its ability of self-correction and its belief in progress and continual improvement--which make it largely impervious to discerning its deepest weaknesses and even self-inflicted decline.**

**No matter our contemporary malady, there is no challenge that can't be fixed by a more perfect application of liberal solutions.**

Among the greatest challenges facing humanity is the ability to survive progress.

According to Thomas Hobbes, human beings exist by nature in a state of radical independence and autonomy.

**Recognizing the fragility of a condition in which life in such a state is "nasty, brutish, and short," they employ their rational self-interest to sacrifice most of their natural rights in order to secure the protection and security of a sovereign. Legitimacy is conferred by consent.**

John Locke, Hobbe's successor and the first philosopher of liberalism, on the one hand acknowledges in his *Second Treatise of Government* that the duties of parents to raise children and the corresponding duties of children to obey spring from the commandment "Honor thy father and mother," but he further claims that every child must ultimately subject his inheritance to the logic of consent, and thus begin (evoking the origin of human society) in a version of the State of Nature in which we act as autonomous choosing individuals.

Even those who adopt the inheritance of their parents in every regard do so only through the logic of consent, even if it is tacit.

Liberalism often claims neutrality about the choices people make in liberal society; it is the defender of "Right," not any particular conception of the "Good."

Liberalism encourages loose connections.

#### The War Against Nature

Liberal philosophy reject this requirement of human self-limitation of Aristotle's *Ethics* and St. Thomas Aquinas' *Theologiae*.

It displaced first the idea of a natural order to which humanity is subject and later the notion of human nature itself.

The first wave of this revolution--inaugurated by early-modern thinkers dating back to the Renaissance--**insisted that man should employ natural science and a transformed economic system to seek mastery of nature.**

The second wave--developed largely by various historicist schools of thought, especially in the nineteenth century--**replaced belief in the idea of a fixed human nature with belief in human "plasticity" and capacity for moral progress.**

These two iterations of liberalism are often labeled "conservative" and "progressive".

Francis Bacon (Hobbes was Bacon's secretary) was the first who attacked these principles, arguing that the human capacity to "master" or "control" nature could go so far to reversing the effects of the Fall, including even the possibility of overcoming human mortality.

The second wave consisted of thinkers ranging from Rousseau to Marx, from Mill to Dewey, and from Richard Rorty to contemporary "transhumanists" reject the idea that human nature is fixed. They adopt the first-wave theorists' idea that nature is subject to human conquest and apply it to human nature itself.

Conservatives, first wave theorists, argue the need of scientific and economic mastery of nature but stop short of most forms of biotechnological "enhancement".

Second wave liberals are for liberating humans from the biological nature of our own bodies.

**Liberalism rejects the ancient conception of liberty as the learned capacity of human beings to conquer the slavish pursuit of base and hedonistic desires. This kind of liberty is a condition of self-governance of both city and soul, drawing closely together the individual cultivation and practice of virtue and the shared activities of self-legislation.**

Liberalism instead understands liberty as the condition in which one can act freely within the sphere unconstrained by positive law.

As the authority of social norms dissipates, they are increasingly felt to be residual, arbitrary, and oppressive, motivating calls for the state to actively work toward their eradication.

Liberalism thus culminates in two ontological points: the liberated individual and the controlling state.

Liberalism can function only by the constant increase of available and consumable material goods, and thus with the constant expansion of nature's conquest and mastery.

<u>**No person can aspire to a position of political leadership by calling for limits and self-command.**</u>

Liberalism's end game is unsustainable in every respect: **it cannot perpetually enforce order upon a collection of autonomous individuals increasingly shorn of constitutive social norms, nor can it provide endless material growth in a world of limits. We can either elect a future of self-limitation born of the practice and experience of self-governance in local communities, or we can back inexorably into a future in which extreme license coexists with extreme oppression.**

## Chapter 2: Uniting Individualism and Statism

**The project of advancing the liberal order takes the superficial form of a battle between seemingly intractable foes, and the energy and acrimony of that contest shrouds a deeper cooperation that ends up advancing liberalism as a whole.**

These apparently contrary positions are familiar to even the casual observer of contemporary American politics, with conservatives--heirs to classical liberalism--typically decrying statism and liberals--heirs to progressivism--criticizing individualism.

This deeper continuity between right and left derives from two main sources: first, philosophical, with both the classical and progressive liberal traditions arguing ultimately for the central role of the state in the creation and expansion of individualism; and second, practical and political, with this joint philosophical project strengthening an expansion of both state power and individualism. **The two "sides" of liberalism, while apparently locked in intense contestation, together advance the main objects of the liberal project.**

**Thus classical liberals claim that the individual is fundamental and, through an act of contract and consent, brings into existence a limited government. Progressive liberals claim that the individual is never wholly self-sufficient, and that we must instead understand ourselves to be more deeply defined by membership in a larger unit of humanity.**

For both "liberals" and "conservatives," the state becomes the main driver of individualism, while individualism becomes the main source of expanding power and authority of the state.

#### Philosophical Sources and Practical Implications--Classical Liberalism

Liberalism establishes a deep and profound connection: its ideal of liberty can be realized only through a powerful state.

#### Philosophical Sources and Practical Implications--Progressive Liberalism

Democracy could no longer mean individual self-reliance based upon the freedom of individuals to act in accordance with their own wishes. Instead, it must be infused with a social and even religious set of commitments that would lead people to recognize their participation in the "brotherhood of mankind."

Walter Rauschenbusch was to echo this sentiment in his call to establish the "Kingdom of God" on earth, a new and more deeply social form of democracy that "would not accept human nature as it is, but move it in the direction of its improvement."

Only through overcoming classic liberalism can progressive liberalism emerge, according to these thinkers.

#### Creating the Individual

At the heart of liberal theory and practice is the preeminent role of the state as agent of individualism.

**This very liberation in turn generates liberalism's self-reinforcing circle, wherein the increasingly disembedded individual ends up strengthening the state that is its own author.**
