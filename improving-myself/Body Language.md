## Comfort/Discomfort: The Core of Body Language

**You don't need to learn all of the different signals with body language.**

There are only two signals you need to learn: "comfort" and "discomfort."

- Comfort signals tell you that the person is feeling good. People give off comfort signals when they like the person they're interacting with, they enjoy their current activity or interaction, and there is nothing troubling them.
- Discomfort signals tell you that something is wrong. People give off discomfort signals when something is bothering them, when they're not feeling happy, or when they are not enjoying their current activity or interaction.

#### Responding To Comfort and Discomfort

If you're picking up "I'm feeling comfortable" messages, then you're got a **green light.**

- simply relax and enjoy the interaction.
- Keep an eye out in case their body language changes to discomfort, but other wise, just relax and keep doing whatever you were doing.

If you're reading "I'm not comfortable" then that's a **red light** (or at least, a yellow "Caution" light).

- Your job is to help your conversation partner feel more comfortable.
- Try to learn what caused them to feel uncomfortable, and see if you can remove the source of the discomfort.

#### Comfort and Discomfort In Practice

An example would be giving a long-winded answer when your partner expects a short response. Keep an eye out for when they look uncomfortable and cut your long answer short. Your friend might not tell you that they are bored, but their body clearly communicated it.
