# Week 10

## 10.1: The Afterlife and the Underworld

- Virgil's trip to the underworld has different function than Homer's

- In Homer's, Odysseus goes down to figure out what wrong he did and how to right it, by finding Tiresias

- this underworld is like a giant holding cell

- all the spirits would rather be alive, they are all in the same boat

- all are the same, none are getting punished when others aren't

- Virgil's underworld is quite different in this regard

  - carefully constructed by Virgil where ethical scores are settled
  - those that have done well in life, they have nice long periods of joyful and happy things that surround their eternity
  - for those that have had evil, they have awful afterlives, they're actually physically punished
  - very different kind of world than Homer's

- intervening traditions help Virgil construct the underworld

  - Roman theological ideas, their ideas about the gods
  - Pythagorean philosophy, example of this underworld shows up in book 10 of Plato's *Republic*, way back in classical Athens
    - not at all a normal belief at the time Plato is talking about it
  - after Virgil makes the underworld look like this, it becomes very popular in the west, and is adopted by Christian theology

- Virgil gets very specific about what happens

- Virgil is bringing his rationalizing brain to bear

- Homer was pretty foggy

- Virgil, we see a full architecture and ways of how everything works

- the underworld is easy to go down, but difficult to return. It is tricky

- Aeneas will have to figure it out

- The Sibyl tells him there is a way: by finding a very special piece of foliage, The Golden Bough

- James Joyd, Geroge Frazier decided to name a seminal work in the study of mythology, in the early 1900's, Golden Bough.

- After this, this image was firmly established, at least in contemporary study of mythology

- When the Sibyl announces it to Virgil, she tells him he'll have to go and find this bough. It is there, and Sibyl tells him that it will come willingly and easily if you are called by fate (line 215). But, if you're not called by fate, there's no way you could rip it off, no matter how strong you are.

- lines 295 and following:

  ```
  So bright amid the dark leaves green ilex shown
  The golden leafage, rustling in light wind.
  Aeneas at once briskly took hold of it
  And, though it clung, greedily broke it off.
  Then carried to the Sibyl's cave (p. 167).
  ```

- though it clung, Aeneas took hold of it and though it clung greedily, it broke off

- Virgil spells out what seems to be a pretty clear middle way between the two distinctive and mutually exclusive possibilities that the Sibyl gave us.

- it doesn't fall off in Aeneas' hand and he's not foiled in his attempt to yank the thing off.

- this is a great example of Virgil finding the middle option of two thought to be the only options.

- He doesn't go back to explain himself, he leaves it in to leave an incrongruity, shadows in his texts, blank spaces that don't seem like they make sense according to the parameters that he himself set up.

- We saw this in the case of the marriage of Dido and Aeneas

- So, was Aeneas supposed to pull that bough off? Was it fated? Well, we don't really know.

- Underworld gods talked about:

  - Hecate, Night, Earth, and Proserpina: Roman name for Persephone

- we are moving down with Aeneas and the Sibyl

- Virgil gives a very elaborate and detailed architecture

- we scary things that are happening, but Virgil reassures us on line 400 that these are empty monsters, so we shouldn't be scared of them.

  - in the underworld, there is no substance, so things cannot hurt you
  - Virgil's scientific mind's perspective

- then, we are on our way to cross over the River Styx and move into limbo and other stages of the underworld.

- on our way, we run into a man, Palinurus, the steerhead who died earlier on Aeneas' ship, without them knowing.

- very much parallel to Elpenor in the Odyssey, he goes to underworld and Elpenor tells him to bury him

- this is where Virgil's story forks: Palinurus is not fulfilling the full story. The Sibyl tells Aeneas that he will be buried by the locals and we need to carry on through the underworld

- A typical Virgilian spin here: takes one character of Elpenor and splits him into two, both Misenus and Palinurus

- we get across the River Styx on Charon's boat, where it creaks upon Aeneas' weight, another rationalization as the boat normally carries weightless shadows

- Cerberus guards the underworld, we toss him a cake, that keeps him quiet and lets us get across.

- Then, we enter into the realm of Limbo: the place for the untimely dead

  - infants, those who have been unjustly condemned, suicides, those who died for love, and we meet Dido there
  - people didn't do wrong who are here, it's just that they died in a way that the circumstances did not allow them to experience the full pleasure, that's possible in an afterlife, and we're going to see what that is

- it's a sad place, not a good place to be

- we judges operating there, Minos making judgement on souls and sending them one direction or another

- as we make our way down, we see a whole mix of people who are mixed up in nasty stuff.

- eventually we get down to Tartarus, where all the worst sinners are

- Aeneas is curious and wants to check it out but Sibyl says no, it is far too terrible to see, too nasty

- Rhadamanthus acts as judge down there and awful things get dealt with in awful ways

- Sibyl then describes it

- page 178, "Dawn crosses the meridian." What does that mean?

  - She describes night arrives Aeneas, we are in a topsy-turvy world
  - Brueghel representation, very descriptive and disturbing: "Aeneas and the Sibyl in the Unerworld, 1630s. Brueghel, Jan the Younger"

- we move away into a different kind of world, one that is brighter and kinder
