# Lecture 1: How to Stop Worrying and Start Investing

Investing is sensible and easy to understand.

### Investing

- Spending money, time, or resources in order to create or acquire assets
- Assets:
  - store resources that you don't need now
- Financial asset: documents that entitle their owners to receive something of value, typically cash payments, from someone else
  - no intrinsic value: piece of paper, collection of digits
- Another name for a financial asset is a Security: written evidence of the extension of a loan
- Real assets: oil, cotton
  - Capital goods: machines, factories, land they sit on
  - Intangible assets/Intellectual Property: Ideas, Knowledge, Skills
- Financial assets derive their value from Real Assets

### Top 4 Threats to Investments

1. Investment loses money because its value falls
   1. Give them time: short term bumps smooth out
   2. If you sell when it crashes, you'll miss out on its recovery
2. Bankruptcy
3. Inflation: perhaps most serious threat to individual investors
   1. CPI, Consumer Price Index: price of common goods
   2. Medical Care and College Tuition inflation are both much more than the average inflation
   3. **Find investments that keep up with inflation (particularly a particular good or service you are saving up for and tracking its inflation)**: **stocks**
      1. tend to be the riskier ones
      2. Treasury bonds are much safer ones but lag behind inflation
4. Biggest threat: human nature
   1. our own psychology and emotions do far more damage than market crashes ever did
   2. herd behavior
   3. look out for scams
   4. Behavioral Economics: how people's decision-making goes wrong, with regards particularly to investments
      1. Confirmation bias: ignore evidence that is contrary to your belief
      2. Loss aversion: take riskier and riskier gambles to compensate for previous losses
