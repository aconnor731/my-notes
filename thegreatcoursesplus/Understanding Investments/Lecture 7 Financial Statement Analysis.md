# Lecture 7: Financial Statement Analysis

Recall that firms issue financial assets to borrow money from investors so that they can buy real assets.

- **the balance sheet helps show this part of the story**
  - Assets, Liabilities
  - Equity = Assets - Liabilities

Campbell's Soup Example:

| Balance Sheet Items (CPB): | 2010 (in millions) |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Accounts Receivable        | 512                |
| Inventory                  | 724                |
| Total Assets               | 6276               |
| Total Current Liabilities  | 5347               |
| Total Equity               | 929                |

Balance Sheet Equity = Book Equity

Accounting books = Book Equity

- This is the accounting value of the company based on its equity rather than its market value

EBIT: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes

### Ratios

**Liquidity ratios**: does a company have enough money to pay liabilities/bills coming due

- **Current ratio**: $ \frac{current\ assets}{current\ liabilities} $
  - for Campbell's: 0.817
- **Quick ratio**: $ \frac{(cash,\ securities,\ accts\ receivable)}{current\ liabilities} $
  - For Campbells: 0.371
- Accounts receivable: what those that have purchased their products owe Campbells

**Leverage ratios**: concerns how much a company is borrowing

- Leverage ratio: $ \frac{total\ assets}{total\ equity} $
  - Campbells: 6.76
    - every dollar of equity represents 6.76 dollars of assets
- this gives a good representation of how leveraged a company is

**Profitability ratios**:

- **Operating margin**: $ \frac{EBIT}{sales} $
  - EBIT = operating income
  - a profit margin
  - Campbells Operating margin: 0.176
    - This means every 17.6 cents of sales is profit

**Efficiency ratios**: how well a company utilizes its assets

- **Asset turnover ratio**: $ \frac{sales}{total\ assets} $
- Campbells asset turnover ratio: $ \frac{7676\ M}{6276\ M} = 1.24 $
  - every dollar of campbells assets produces $1.24 of sales per year

The Best Ratios:

**Performance Ratios**: try to measure, in an accounting sense, the return that different investors would get by lending a dollar to the company

 **ROA (Return on Assets)** and **ROE (Return on Equity)**

**ROA**: $ \frac{(EBIT - taxes)}{total\ assets} $

- numerator: profits that could be distributed to bondholders and stock holders
- calculates in accounting terms, and not market terms, the return you would earn by financing company's assets a dollar by buying both the company's stocks and bonds
  - in same proportions as listed on their balance sheet
  - for example, with Campbell's, you're buying $5.76 worth of bonds for every \$1 of stock
  - For Campbells: $ \frac{1348\ M - 398\ M}{6276\ M} = \frac{950\ M}{6276\ M} = 0.154 = 15.4\% $

**ROE**: $ \frac{net\ income}{equity} $

- Campbells: $ \frac{844\ M}{929\ M} = 0.909 = 90.9\% $

You have to grab other stocks in the same industry to compare ROE and ROAs.
