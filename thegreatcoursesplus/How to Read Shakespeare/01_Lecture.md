# Lecture 1

### 2 fundamental premises:

- Shakespeare teaches us how to "get" his plays
- We love Shakespeare's plays when we better understand them

### Course Goals

- Confidently read Shakespeare's plays
- Understand
  - surface events
  - deeper meanings
  - hidden symbols
  - themes and patterns
  - dramatic techniques
  - "tools of the trade"

### First tool to understanding Shakespeare: <u>Start with a scene</u>

### Second tool: <u>Words, words, words</u>

- he uses his language to mean something other than the literal meaning

Later, Juliet will call Romeo "the god of my idolatry"

His language has many meanings and level of meanings.

Wherefore: for what purpose? why?

- "Wherefore art thou Romeo?" Why are you a Capulet?

Shakespeare's vocabulary: 29,000 (almost twice of the average college student)

Juliet later says: What difference is the name?

Words are of enormous importance.

**Shakespeare used language to show the rich meanings that words and life contain.**

We want to focus on the words to what and how they mean.

**Is he best appreciated on the page or stage?** <u>It's both</u>

- Understand fully by reading
- Shakespeare wrote for the stage

Shakespeare primarily wrote these plays for the stage. We must keep this in mind while reading.

**Stagecraft: Use of tools to attain dramatic effect**

**Shakespeare most rewards an ongoing engagement with his work.**

**Shakespeare's work requires our participation**

"Let us on your imaginary forces work." - The first line of Shakespeare he tells his students to memorize.

- **We must actively enlist our imagination**
- The power lies in us to make the magic work

Magic: the power to use words to achieve transformative works

**What book should we read?**

- Complete editions:
  - The Norton Shakespeare
    - very substantial footnotes, background information, etc.
    - all of Shakespeare's nondramatic poems
  - The Riverside Shakespeare
    - like Norton
    - a bit more readable, elegant

We'll be covering 12 of his works, 1/3 of his work.

Remember, the goal of this course is to give comprehension to any of his plays, even those we don't go over.

**Important**:

- **Start with a scene**
- **Words, words, words**
- **Stagecraft**
- **Imaginary forces**
