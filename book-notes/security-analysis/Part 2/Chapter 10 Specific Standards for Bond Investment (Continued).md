# Chapter 10: Specific Standards for Bond Investment (*Continued*)

## The Relation of the Value of the Property to the Funded Debt

The New York law, for example, will not admit as eligible a gas, electric, or telephone bond, unless it is secured by property having a value 66.6% in excess of the bond issue.

### Special Types of Obligations: 1. Equipment Obligations.

### 2. Collateral-trust Bonds.

Collateral-trust bonds are obligations secured by the pledge of stocks or other bonds, usually bonds or stocks of the company directly or through subsidiaries.

**This type of collateral-trust bond may therefore be ranked with equipment-trust obligations as exceptions to our general rule that the bond buyer must place his chief reliance on the success of the enterprise and not on the property specifically pledged.**

In their opinion, the intrinsic strength of such obligations is often impaired unnecessarily by hesitation in asserting the bondholders' rights.

### 3. Real Estate Bonds

**Of much greater importance than either of the two types of securities just discussed is the large field of real estate mortgages and real estate mortgage bonds.**

The values behind real estate mortgages are *going-concern values*; i.e., they are derived fundamentally from the earning power of the property, either actual or presumptive.

In other words, the value of the pledged asset is not something *distinct* from the success of the enterprise (as is possibly the case with a railroad-equipment trust certificate), but is rather *identical* therewith.

Most typical form of real estate loan: a first mortgage on a single-family dwelling house.

Under ordinary conditions a home costing $10,000 would have a rental value (or an equivalent value to an owner-tenant) of some $1,200 per year, and would yield a net income of about $800 after taxes and expenses.

A 5% first-mortgage loan on the savings-bank basis, i.e., 60% of value, or $6,000, would therefore be protected by a normal *earning power* of over twice the interest requirements.

*Property Values and Earning Power Closely Related.*

**The market value of these properties is closely related to the *expected* rental when improved or let. (It is emphatically not true, however, of buildings erected for a special purpose, such as factories, etc.)**

*Misleading Character of Appraisals*

This led to the real-estate mortgage bond crisis between 1923 and 1929 (sound familiar).

**When a structure is built for a *specific* purpose, it loses the quality of rapid disposability, and *its value becomes bound up with the success of the particular enterprise for whose use it was originally intended***.

When investments of the kind of mortgage bonds and their corollaries are made, the lender should be certain: **(a) that the amount of the loan is not over 66.67% of the value of the property, as shown either by actual recent cost or by the amount which an experienced real estate man would consider a fair price *to pay* for the property; and (b) that this cost or fair price does not reflect recent speculative inflation and does not greatly exceed the price levels existing for a long period previously.**
