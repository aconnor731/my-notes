# Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy Notes

A **cognition**: a thought or perception.

Proverbs 23:7 - "For as he thinks within himself, so he is."

"For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so" - *Hamlet*, Act 2, Scene 2

Based on findings from a research study, Dr. Antonuccio and his coauthors concluded that psychotherapy should be considered a second-rate treatment but should usually be the **initial treatment for depression**.

Bibliotherapy: reading therapy (simply reading a good self-help book like *Feeling Good* without any other therapy)

- Dr. Forest Scogin and his colleagues at the University of Alabama found this to be as effective as a full course of psychotherapy or treatment with the best antidepressant drugs (Initially published in the prestigious *Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology* and in *The Gerontologist*)

Studies of conventional cognitive therapy and medication-based therapy in comparison with bibliotherapy have shown that bibliotherapy works just as well in a shorter period of time (4 weeks compared to 12 weeks).

This shows that **you can defeat depression by changing the negative thinking patterns that cause it.**

We now have three types of effective treatment for depression:

- antidepressant medications
- individual and group psychotherapy
- bibliotherapy

**Dr. Burns initially imagined this book would be used as cognitive bibliotherapy between therapy sessions to speed your recovery even if you are in treatment.**

In 1994, the results of a nationwide survey about the use of bibliotherapy by mental health professionals were published in the *Authoritative Guide to Self-Help* (published by Guilford Press, New York).

**_Feeling Good_ was the number-one-rated book for depressed patients in a survey of 500 mental health professionals who were asked if they recommended self-help books and which books they recommended. *Feeling Good Handbook* (published as a Plume paperback in 1989) was rated number 2.**

**No matter how terrible your depression and anxiety may feel, the prognosis for recovery is excellent.**

## Part 1: Theory and Research

### Chapter 1: A Breakthrough in the Treatment of Mood Disorders

Depression is an illness and not a necessary part of healthy living.

What's more important--you *can* overcome it by learning some simple methods for mood elevation.

**Cognitive therapy is *not* just another self-help fad but a major development that has become an important part of the mainstream of modern psychiatric research and practice.**

**The first principle of cognitive therapy: *all* your moods are created by your "cognitions," or thoughts.**

A cognition refers to the way you look at things--your perceptions, mental attitudes, and beliefs.

You *feel* the way you do right now because of the *thoughts you are thinking at this moment.*

Your thought actually *creates* the emotion.

**The second principle of cognitive therapy is that when you are feeling depressed, your thoughts are dominated by pervasive negativity**.

- you perceive not only yourself but the entire world in dark, gloomy terms
- what is even worse--you'll come to believe things *really are* as bad as you imagine them to be

**The third principle is of substantial philosophical and therapeutic importance. Our research has documented that the <u>negative thoughts which cause your emotional turmoil nearly *always* contain gross distortions</u>.**

My depression is probably not based on accurate perceptions of reality but is often the product of mental slippage.

The most important result of their clinical research: **I can learn to deal with my moods more effectively if you master methods that will help you pinpoint and eliminate the mental distortions which cause you to feel upset.**

As I begin to think more objectively, I will begin to feel better.
