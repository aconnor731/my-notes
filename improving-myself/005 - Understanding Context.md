## Understanding Context

If you only look at their body language, you won't have enough information to identify the source of their discomfort. Body language will tell you that someone is comfortable or uncomfortable, but it can't tell you why.

That's why you look at the context.

### What Is Context?

Looking at context means being aware of three things:

- **The conversation itself.**
  For instance, if your partner's language changed when you asked a specific question, perhaps there is something about that question that made them uncomfortable.
- **The environment the conversation takes place in.**
- **Your partner's recent experiences**.
