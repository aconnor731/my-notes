- Nietzsche - If you want to hurt someone, punish them not when they are wrong, but when they are right
- Do not focus on the small things your partner does wrong
- Reward the behavior you want from your partner and **be patient**
- Your partner does not know what you want **unless you tell them**
- It takes 6 months to try, develop, and incorporate behavior
  - let them do it badly for awhile
  - look how hard it is to change your own behavior
