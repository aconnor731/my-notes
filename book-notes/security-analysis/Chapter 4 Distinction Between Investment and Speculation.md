# Chapter 4: Distinction Between Investment and Speculation

### General Connotations of the Term "Investment."

It is commonly thought that investment, in this special sense, is good for everybody and at all times. Speculation, on the other hand, may be good or bad, depending on the conditions and the person who speculates.

Something can be said for the cynic's definition that **an investment is a successful speculation and a speculation is an unsuccessful investment.**

### Distinctions Commonly Drawn between the Two Terms.

| Investment                | Speculation          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1. In bonds.              | In stocks.           |
| 2. Outright purchases.    | Purchases on margin. |
| 3. For permanent holding. | For a "quick turn."  |
| 4. For income.            | For profit.          |
| 5. In safe securities.    | In risky issues.     |

The race-track gambler, betting on a "sure thing," is convinced that his commitment is safe. The 1929 "investor" in high-priced common stocks also considered himself safe in his reliance upon future growth to justify the figure he paid and more.

#### Standards of Safety

The concept of safety can be really useful only if it is based on something more tangible than the psychology of the purchaser.

The safety must be assured, or at least strongly indicated, by the application of **definite and well-established standards.**

#### A Proposed Definition of Investment.

The expectation of safety must be based on **study and standards.**

**Proper definition of Investment**: *An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.*
