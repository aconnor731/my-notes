## The Secret of Conversation Flow

**Conversation flow** happens when conversation is comfortable, effortless and smooth. It is the way conversations are supposed to work.

What do you do when conversations don't flow? That's where the principle of **invitation and inspiration** comes in. They are the key ingredients of smooth, comfortable conversation.

- An **invitation** is when you say something that explicitly lets your partner know it is their turn to speak.
- An **inspiration** is when you say something that makes your partner want to speak unbidden.

Here's how it works:

**The Deli Metaphor**

Imagine your partner and yourself are working at a deli shop and are working together to make a sandwich with each of you at opposite ends of the counter. You each pass the sandwich to the other after adding something.

You ask, "How was your weekend?" and slide the sandwich down the counter.

Your partner replies, "Oh, it was great. How was yours?" and slides the sandwich back.

You reply "It was fine." and try to return the sandwich but it travels six inches and stops dead.

What happened? You didn't give your partner a clear **invitation** or a strong **inspiration**. Without either of those things, your partner didn't know what to say next (and perhaps was unsure if it was his turn to speak) so he didn't respond.

You want to be deliberate to offer invitations and inspirations to your partner.

### Invitation: The Art of Good Questions

An **invitation** is something you say that:

- communicates very clearly that it is now your partner's turn to talk,

  and

- gives a strong suggestion for what your partner should talk about.

For instance, "What did you do today?" is an invitation.

Most invitations are questions, but not all questions are good invitations.

For a question to be a good invitation, **it needs to satisfy the first two rules I listed above, and it also needs to be open-ended.**

#### The Power of Good Questions

"Open-end question": an invitation that allows your partner to talk at length, instead of being limited to a short answer.

This: "What did you do this weekend?"

Not this: "Did you have a good weekend?"

Not only does inviting your partner to share help the conversation to flow, but it also gives you an opportunity to show your partner that **you are interested in them**.

The classic writing rule of "Show, don't tell" applies to conversation, too.

#### How to Ask Good Questions

There is an art to asking good, insightful questions.

Don't ask questions that are too superficial nor too intimate.

The trick is to **start superficial, and then slowly go more intimate while keeping an eye on the other person's <u>comfort</u> level.**

If you don't know the person that well, don't go too intimate. Over time as you get to know them, you can ask more intimate questions.

Also, if you ask the other person more intimate questions, you should share more intimate things about yourself. If you don't open to them after they have opened up to you, they will quickly become uncomfortable.

However, as handy as invitations are, you can't build an entire conversation out of them. That is where inspirations come in.

### Inspiration in Practice

When you want to inspire your partner, be deliberate to share something that might inspire them to share their **curiosity**, their **thoughts**, or their **story**.

- these are not the only ways to inspire your partner--anything that encourages your partner to share is an inspiration.

#### Inspire Them To Share Their Curiosity

Share something they want to know about. Use your knowledge of the other person to guide you as you craft great inspirations.

Just make an honest effort to think about what the other person would be interested in, and you will usually end up ok.

#### Inspire Them To Share Their Thoughts

When you share your thoughts, it encourages your partner to share their own.

Be careful. if you sound like you're lecturing when you share your thoughts, or you belittle people who disagree with you, your partner will not feel comfortable to share their own thoughts.

Ask your friends and family for honest feedback on how well you welcome the thoughts and opinions of others. You might be doing something unconscious that causes others to feel uncomfortable.

#### Inspire Them To Share Their Story

The best way to inspire your partner to share their story is to share your own story, things like marriage, graduation, your years in high school, etc.

Talking about why Captain Kirk could totally beat up Han Solo does not count as your story (because you're not talking about you!).

Remember the rules of intimacy from before: if you just met this person, it is probably best not to share a really private part of your story. Over time, you can share more intimate details.

### Invitation and Inspiration In Harmony

Great conversations need both invitation and inspiration.

A conversation based entirely around invitations can sound like an interview--nothing but questions and answers. And conversations based entirely around inspirations are hard to do--what happens when you attempt to inspire your partner and they don't respond?

Invitations add **guidance and structure** to a conversation, and inspirations add **intimacy and flexibility**.

In general, this means you should start conversations with mostly invitations, and use more inspirations as the conversation progresses.

You should use invitations more frequently:

- When the conversation begins
- When you don't know the other person very well
- When your partner doesn't seem to know what to say next

And you should use inspiration more frequently:

- After your partner has shared something personal with you
- After your partner has asked you a personal question
- After you've gotten to know your partner better.

#### Moving Between Invitation and Inspiration

Start conversations with mostly invitations and then move to mostly inspirations, because this starts with the focus on your partner, not you.

Starting with inspirations puts the focus on you first. You don't want to seem self-centered.

Now, once you know someone well, you don't need to worry about this as much.

But as a general rule, it's always safe to start with more invitations and omve to more inspirations.

### The Deli, Day 2

Be specific in your response to how your weekend was because it gives plenty of things for your partner to choose from to ask you about.

You don't need to inspire curiosity and thoughts and story-sharing all at the same time. The important thing is that you shared something about yourself, and you created a space where your partner could share something about themselves.

Combine inspiration with invitation, and you now have the tools to make sure that every one of your conversations flows smoothly and feels natural.

Instructions for how to use those tools is very simple:
**Each time that you speak, either give your partner an explicit invitation to speak, or share something that inspires your partner to share in return.**
