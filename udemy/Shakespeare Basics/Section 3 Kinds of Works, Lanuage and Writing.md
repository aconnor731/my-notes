# Section 3: Kinds of Works, Lanuage and Writing

## 6. Poems and Their Themes

His works can be divided into two categories:

- Plays
- Poems

Themes: major idea of the poem

Shakespeare's sonnets:

- 154 sonnets
- First 126: Beautiful young man
- First 20: Procreation sonnets
  - not to procreate is selfish and does not service to a man
- 126-152: The Dark Lady
  - the opposite of what people expect of a woman
  - the opposite of attractiveness in woman
  - Shakespeare defies tradition
- Both contain Themes:
  - Romantic love
  - Beauty
  - Lust
- Sonnets 153 and 154 are not directed towards the Dark Lady or the Beautiful young man but to Cupid
  - discuss love
- Also wrote long poems "Venus and Adonis" and "Rape of Lucrece" and shorter poems: "A Lover's Complaint" and "The Phoenix and the Turtle"
  - themes:
    - Lust and Unrequited Love
- Most famous form of poetry was the Sonnet, but also longer forms of poetry as well that dealt with love and lust for both men and women

## 7. Plays and Their Themes

3 genres:

- history
- comedy
- tragedy
  - Hamlet
  - King Lear

3 levels:

1. The Individual
2. Social Level
   1. family, nation, society
3. Natural level
   1. landscape and nature of the play

## 8: Structure and Style

Sonnets:

- brought into England from Italian origins
- 14 line poems
- 3 quatrain and couplet
- A-B-A-B-C-D-C-D-E-F-E-F-G-G
  - 1st quatrain: A-B-A-B
  - 2nd quatrain: C-D-C-D
  - 3rd quatrain: E-F-E-F
  - couplet: G-G
- Last couplet was a way of doing a reversal, or a decision
- Most sonnets were meant to express an emotion or feeling

Why did Shakespeare make the decision to have a structure with such a long string of sonnets?

1. Talk about many different types of emotional states
2. He could change these emotional states with each sonnet
3. The poems are still ordered in a particular way (whether or not it has narrative sense)
4. Bringing home the same idea or similar feelings. Persuasion. Echo chamber.

5 Acts with multiple scenes in each Act:

- think of each Act as a part and each scene a smaller part within those parts
- Scenes for changing time:
  - changing location
  - going to a new subplot
  - introducing new characters
  - rearranging actors

Most of what Shakespeare wrote was in Blank Verse:

- unrhymed poetry written in regular rhythm known as **Iambic Pentameter**
- **Iambs**: One unstressed beat and one stressed beat
- **Pentameter**: lines of the poem have five feet, each foot has a number of syllables

A stressed syllable can be thought of as a strong syllable, an unstressed syllable as a weak syllable.

Example: "If music be the food of love, play on."

Interpreted: "if MUsic BE the FOOD of LOVE, play ON"

| IAMB        | Penta    | Total              |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| 2 syllables | x 5 feet | 10 total syllables |

Othello, Act 2, Scene 2:

```
Othello: O my fair warrior! (6)
Desdemona:                 My dear Othello! (5)
```

- Does not add up to 10. He does this sometimes to emphasize a point.
- Adds random spacing to show how well two characters get along.
