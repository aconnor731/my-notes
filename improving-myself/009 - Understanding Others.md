# Understanding Others

If you really want to understand others, you need more than self-empathy.

You also need to spend some time thinking about the way other people understand the world.

It really boils down to one thing:

Train yourself to ask the question "**How does this situation appear to the other person**?" during **every interaction**--and spend the brain cycles necessary to think of a reasonable answer.

#### Empathy and the Art of Sock Collection

For instance, let's say a friend corners you and starts chatting about a topic you find excruciatingly boring (their sock collection, perhaps).

If you take the time to look at it from the friend's perspective, **you get a better understanding of their actions.**

Most likely, if the person is your friend, they care about you and they're not trying to bore you.

Chances are that in their excitement to tell someone about their new alpaca wool crew socks, they just forgot how boring socks are to you.

Once you take the time to look at it from their perspective, **you can handle the situation in a much better way.**

#### The Danger of Your Perspective

Unfortuanately, our natural tendency is to see things from our own perspective (that's why it's called OUR perspective).

**Our motives might not be obvious to our partner.**

#### The Need for Discipline

Everything changed once he started to train himself in empathy. He began asking himself, "Why are my parents so upset?"

People are not mind-readers, and so they couldn't know my motives--only my actions.

He would ask himself, "How would this look to my parents?"

This illustrates a key point, when people do something that seems irrational to you, it **still makes sense from their perspective.**

If you take the time to step back and ask "Ok, why is this person behaving like this?" you will usually find a reasonable answer, and that answer will help you to respond better.

Asking that question does not happen automatically. **You need to make a deliberate decision** to ask yourself "How does this look to the other person?"

**You need to be willing to surrender your insistence that the other person see things your way. And you need to do this again and again and again, until it becomes automatic.**

#### The Power of True Empathy

Building empathy is not easy.

As you continue to ask yourself "How does this situation appear to the other person?" something remarkable will occur. The question will become less and less necessary. You will start to intuitively sense how the other person is feeling.

In other words, **you will start to develop true empathy.**

This takes time as it is overwriting many years of habit of looking at the world exclusively through your own perspective. But it is worth it.

In the conversations you have today, ask yourself "What is the other person thinking and feeling right now? How are they perceiving this interaction?"

You won't now for sure if your guess is accurate, but more likely than not, you'll be close.

It will take time to become comfortable with this, but it becomes easier each time you do it. Once you learn to develop empathy with others, it will become second nature to show empathy to them.
