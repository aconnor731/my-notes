# Ovid Notes

## Book 3

### Characters of Importance

- Pentheus:

  - refused to acknowledge the foreigner to his kingdom of Thebes was indeed Bacchus, or Dionysus, the god of wine and excitement.
  - Bacchus was delivered to him as his prisoner, and Pentheus sentenced him to the torture chamber
  - he was eventually ripped apart by his own mother, Agave, for she could not recognize her son from her quarry, and other women worshiping Bacchus

- Teiresias:

  - a seer who was blinded by Juno because Jupiter wagered with her that women have more enjoyment in sex than men do.
  - since he had the unique experience of having sex as both a man and a woman (this happening because he disrupted a pair of enormous snakes who were coupling together by cudgeling them with his staff; he was amazingly transformed into a woman for 7 years and saw the very same snakes, cudgeled them again, and returned to a male)
  - Jupiter won his bet, and Juno, in her disproportionate fury, blinded him but awarded the gift of clairvoyance and high prestige to console him.

- Bacchus, aka Dionysus:

  - line 665:

    ```
    And there was Bacchus himself,
    his forehead adorned with a garland of ripening bunches of grapelets,
    waving a spear emblazoned with vine leaves; lying around him a mirage of savage tigers, lynxes and spotted panthers.
    ```


## Book 12

- Caeneus, who King Nestor explains, had a similar impregnability and had originally been a woman, kind of like Teiresias.
  - the sex-change, followed another rape by Neptune.
