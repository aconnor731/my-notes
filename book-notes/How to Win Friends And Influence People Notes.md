- "If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return - if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve."

- There is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. **The law is this: *Always make the other person feel important*.**
  - John Dewey said the desire to be important **is the deepest urge in human nature**
  - It is this urge that differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge that has been responsible for civilization itself.
- The most important precept taught by nearly all religions, dating back 2500 years ago to Zoroaster: **"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."**
- You want your friends and associates to be, as Charles Schwab put it, "hearty in their approbation and lavish in their praise." All of us want that.
- Little phrases such as "I'm sorry to trouble you," "Would you be so kind as to ---?" "Won't you please?" "Would you mind?" "Thank you" - little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life - and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.
- **Such is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere, heartfelt appreciation.**
- The life of many a person could probably be changed if only someone would make him feel important.

## Part Three: How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking

### 1. You Can't Win an Argument

- "Frank, you knew that quotation was from Shakespeare." "Yes, of course," he replied, "*Hamlet*, Act Five, Scene Two. But we were guests at a festive occasion, my dear Dale. Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why not let him save his face? He didn't ask for your opinion. He didn't want it. Why argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle."
- There is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it. **Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.**
- **You can't win an argument. You can't because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it.**
- "A man convinced against his will Is of the same opinion still."
- "He is speechless then. There is no room for an argument. If he says the Whose-It is best and I say sure it is, he has to stop. He can't keep on all afternoon saying, 'It's the best' when I'm agreeing with him. We then get off the subject of Whose-It and I begin to talk about the good points of the White Truck."
- **As Ben Franklin use to say: "If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent's good will."**
- So figure it out for yourself. Which would you rather have, an academic, theatrical victory or a person's good will? You can seldom have both.
- The tax inspector was demonstrating one of the most common of human frailties. He wanted a feeling of importance; and as long as Mr. Parsons argued with him, he got his feeling of importance by loudly asserting his authority. But as soon as his importance was admitted and the argument stopped and he was permitted to expand his ego, he became a sympathetic and kindly human being.
- Buddha said, "Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love," and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person's viewpoint.
- In an article in *Bits and Pieces,* some suggestions are made on how to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument:
  - *Control your temper*. Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry.
  - *Look for areas of agreement*. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree.
  - *Be honest*. Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness.
  - *Promise to think over your opponents' ideas and study them carefully*. And mean it.
  - *Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest.* Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are.
  - *Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem.*
  - Opera tenor Jan Peerce, after he was married nearly fifty years, once said: "My wife and I made a pact a long time ago, and we've kept it no matter how angry we've grown with each other. When one yells, the other should listen - because when two people yell, there is no communication, just noise and bad vibrations."

**<u>Principle 1</u>**: **The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.**

### 2. A Sure Way of making Enemies - and How to Avoid It

- Galileo said, "You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself."
- You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broad-minded as you are.
- "I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of damage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she is wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity and making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion."
- Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., "I judge people by their own principles - not by my own."
- Two thousand years ago, Jesus said: "Agree with thine adversary quickly."

**<u>Principle 2</u>**: **Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong."

### 3. If You're Wrong, Admit It

- That policeman, being human, wanted a feeling of importance; so when I began to condemn myself, the only way he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the magnanimous attitude of showing mercy.
- Remember the old proverb, "By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected."

**<u>Principle 3</u>: If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.**
