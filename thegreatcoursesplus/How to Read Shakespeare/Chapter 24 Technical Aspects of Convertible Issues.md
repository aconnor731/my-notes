# Chapter 24: Technical Aspects of Convertible Issues

First **convertible issues.**

2 main terms that frequently change for convertible issues:

1. decrease in conversion price to avoid dilution for the holder
2. increase in the conversion price for the benefit of the company

### Dilution, and Antidilution Clauses.

The value of a common stock is said to be diluted if there is an increase in the number of shares without a corresponding increase in assets and earning power.

Let $ C $ be the conversion price,
$ O $ be the number of shares now outstanding,
$ N $ be the number of new shares to be issued,
and $ P $ be the price at which they are to be issued.

Then:

$ C^{'} = \frac{CO + NP}{O + N} $

Where $ C^{'} $ is the new conversion price.

### *Protection against Dilution Not Complete*

Although practically all convertibles now have antidilution provisions, there are have been exceptions.

### Sliding Scales Designed to Accelerate Conversion.

### Issues Convertible into Preferred Stock.

Many bond issues were formerly made convertible into preferred stock.
