## Your Body Language

It's true that only a few people have trained themselves to consciously analyze body language. 

But even if your conversation partner never consciously thinks about your body language, they will still subconsciously react to it.

For instance, if your body language exhibits warmth and friendliness, your partner is likely to sense that and relax.

If your body language demonstrates disinterest or boredom, your partner will think twice before sharing something personal with you.

### When Your Body Language And Your Words Don't Agree

Unfortunately, most people don't think about their own body language.

They worry instead on the perfect words to say, but never realize that their body langauge and their words are sending very different messages.

### The Power of Self-Awareness

**Be aware** of the messages your body is sending.

Your body is going to communicate--that's just part of being human.

Take the time to notice what it is communicating, and you can make sure that your body and your words are sending the same message.

I'm not talking about changing your body language to mask deception--if your words are communicating something untrue, then you should change your words instead of your body language.

Instead, focus on presenting a cohesive, genuine message of the thing that is both **true** and **most important.**

If you are tired but you care about your friend, the message that is most important is "I care about you" not "I'm tired" (even though both messages are true).
