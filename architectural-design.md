Perry and Wolf defines a software architecture as a set of architectural *elements* that have a particular *form*, explicated by a set of *rationale*.

Architectural elements include processing, data, and connecting elements.

Form is defined by the properties of the elements and the relationships among the elements-that is, the constraints on the elements.

The rationale provides the underlying basis for the architecture by capturing the motivation for the choice of architectural style, the choice of elements, and the form.

Rationale is replaced with architectural properties in this system.

Perry and Wolf model:
- *Processing elements*: those that perform transformations on data
- *Data elements*: those that contain the information that is used and transformed
- *Connecting elements*: the glue that holds the different pieces of the architecture together
