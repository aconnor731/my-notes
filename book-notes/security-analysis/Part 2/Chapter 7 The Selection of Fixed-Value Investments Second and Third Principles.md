# Chapter 7: The Selection of Fixed-Value Investments: Second and Third Principles

## II. Bonds Should Be Bought on a Depression Basis

Prudent investors have always favored the obligations of old-established enterprises which have demonstrated their ability to come through bad times as well as good.

### Presumption of Safety Based upon Either the Character of the Industry or the Amount of Protection.

### No Industry Entirely Depression-proof.

It is not between industries which are *exempt* from and those which are *affected* by depression, but rather between those **which are more and those which are less subject to fluctuation.**

### Investment Practice Recognizes Importance of Character of the Industry.

### Depression Performance as a Test of Merit.

### Various Causes of Bond Collapses.

1. *Excessive Funded Debt of Utilities*
   1. The public-utility defaults were caused not by a disappearance of earnings but by the inability of overextended debt structures to withstand a relatively moderate setback.
   2. The losses of investors in public-utility bonds could for the most part have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary prudence in bond selection.
2. *Stability of Railroad Earnings Overrated.*
3. *Depression Performance of Industrial Bonds*.
   1. Even a high margin of safety in good times may prove ineffective against a succession of operating losses caused by prolonged adversity.

Upon examining the behavior of the industrial bond list in 1932-1933 (taking all issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange), only **18 out of some 200 companies maintained a price** reflecting reasonable confidence in the safety of the issue.

The less drastic test of 1937-1938 points to a conventional conclusion that **issues strongly buttressed by past earnings can be relied on to withstand depressions.**

Large companies are more able to withstand depressions that smaller companies.

**Bonds of smaller industrial companies are not well qualified for consideration as fixed-value investments.**

### Unavailability of Sound Bonds No Excuse for Buying Poor Ones.

**No consideration can justify the purchase of unsound bonds at an investment price.**

### Conflicting Views on Bond Financing

It is wrong to believe that companies issue bonds for financing when they cannot raise funds through the sale of stock.

### Proper Theory of Bond Financing

A good amount of debt is good for both the bond issuing company and the public purchasing them.

### Unsound Policies Followed in Practice.

Also unwise, any strong enterprises pay off their debts through the sale of additional stock.

### Significance of the Foregoing to the Investor.

**The investor should refrain from any purchases on an investment basis if the suitable ones are not available.**

A prudent and intelligent investor should be able to avoid this temptation, and reconcile himself to **accepting an unattractive yield from the best bonds, in preference to risking his principal in second-grade issues for the sake of a large coupon return.**

### Summary.

**Bonds should be bought on the basis of their ability to withstand depression and is part of an old investment tradition.**

**The investor would seem to gain better protection against adverse developments by confining his industrial selections to companies which meet the two requirements of:**

1. <u>**dominant size**</u>
2. <u>**substantial margin of earnings over bond interest**</u>

## III. Third Principle: Unsound to Sacrifice Safety for Yield

In traditional theory of bond investment **a mathematical relationship is supposed to exist between the interest rate and the degree of risk incurred.**

The interest return is divided into two components:

- "pure interest"--i.e., the rate obtainable with *no* risk of loss
- the premium--obtained to compensate for the risk assumed

Example:

If the "pure interest rate" is assumed to be 2%, then a 3% investment is supposed to involve one chance in a hundred of loss, while the risk incurred in an 7% investment would be five times as great, or 1 in 20.

**This theory implies that bond-interest rates are closely similar to insurance rates.**

- they measure the degree of risk on some reasonable precise actuarial basis.

### No Mathematical Relationship between Yield and Risk.

**This view, however, seems to us to bear little relation to the realities of bond investment.**

Security prices and yields depend on the **_popularity_** of the issue, rather than a precise mathematical calculation.

The relation between different kinds of investments and the risk of loss **is entirely too indefinite, and too variable with changing conditions**, to permit of sound mathematical formulation.

- this is particularly true because **investment losses are not distributed fairly evenly in point of time, but tend to be concentrated at intervals, *i.e.*, during periods of general depression.**
  - i.e., the incalculable factor in fire or life insurance

### Self-insurance Generally Not Possible in Investment.

If there were a directly mathematical relationship between security prices and yields, then the result of this premise should be inevitably to recommend the lowest yielding--and therefore the safest--bonds to all investors.

### The Factor of Cyclical Risks.

The individual investor should not attempt to become an insurance company as the bond buyer is neither financially nor psychologically equipped to carry on extensive transactions involving the setting up of reserves out of regular income to absorb losses in substantial amounts suffered at irregular intervals.

### Risk and Yield Are Incommensurable.

(They are not able to be judged by the same standards; having no common standard of measurement)

Acknowledged risks of losing principal **should not be offset merely by a high coupon rate**, but can be accepted only in return for a corresponding **opportunity for enhancement of principal**, *e.g.*, through the purchase of bonds at a substantial discount from par, or possibly by obtaining an unusually attractive conversion privilege.

While there may be no real *mathematical* difference between offsetting risks of loss by a higher income or by a chance for profit, **the _psychological_ difference is very important**.

### Fallacy of the "Business Man's Investment."

This is what is commonly referred to in the financial world as a "business man's investment."

In their view, such "business man's investments" are an illogical type of commitment.

**The security buyer who can afford to take some risk should seek a commensurate <u>opportunity of enhancement in price</u> and pay only secondary attention to the income obtained.**

### Reversal of Customary Procedure Recommended.

It would be well if investors reversed their customary attitude toward income return.

It would be a sounder procedure to avoid the top down approach of finding the best bonds by starting with minimum standards of safety, which all bonds must be required to meet in order to be eligible for further consideration.

- any issues that fail these minimum requirements should be immediately disqualified, regardless of high yield, attractive prospects, or other grounds for partiality

**Essentially, bond selection should consist of working upward from definite minimum standards rather than working downward in haphazard fashion from some ideal but unacceptable level of maximum security.**
