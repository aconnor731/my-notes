# Chapter 4: Distinction Between Investment and Speculation

### General Connotations of the Term "Investment."

It is commonly thought that investment, in this special sense, is good for everybody and at all times. Speculation, on the other hand, may be good or bad, depending on the conditions and the person who speculates.

Something can be said for the cynic's definition that **an investment is a successful speculation and a speculation is an unsuccessful investment.**

### Distinctions Commonly Drawn between the Two Terms.

| Investment                | Speculation          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1. In bonds.              | In stocks.           |
| 2. Outright purchases.    | Purchases on margin. |
| 3. For permanent holding. | For a "quick turn."  |
| 4. For income.            | For profit.          |
| 5. In safe securities.    | In risky issues.     |

The race-track gambler, betting on a "sure thing," is convinced that his commitment is safe. The 1929 "investor" in high-priced common stocks also considered himself safe in his reliance upon future growth to justify the figure he paid and more.

#### Standards of Safety

The concept of safety can be really useful only if it is based on something more tangible than the psychology of the purchaser.

The safety must be assured, or at least strongly indicated, by the application of **definite and well-established standards.**

#### A Proposed Definition of Investment.

The expectation of safety must be based on **study and standards.**

**Proper definition of Investment**: *An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.*

An "analysis" that recommended investment in General Electric common at a **price forty times its highest recorded earnings** merely because of its excellent prospects would be clearly ruled out, as devoid of all quality of thoroughness.

A safe bond, for example, is one which could suffer default only under exceptional and highly improbable circumstances.

Investment must always consider the *price* as well as the *quality* of the security.

In their opinion, **the great majority of common stocks of strong companies must be considered speculative during most of the time**, simply because their price is too high to warrant safety of principal in any intelligible sense of the phrase.

**_<u>An investment operation is one that can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.</u>_**

## Other Aspects of Investment and Speculation

### Relation of the Future to Investment and Speculation.

It may be said, with some approximation to the truth, that **investment is grounded on the past whereas speculation looks primarily to the future.**

- this statement is far from complete

**<u>For investment, the future is essentially something _to be guarded against_ rather than to be profited from.</u>**

Speculation, on the other hand, may always properly--and often soundly--derive its basis and its justification from prospective developments that differ from past performance.

### Types of "Investment."

1. **Business Investment**: Referring to money put or held in a business.
2. **Financial investment or investment generally**: Referring to securities generally.
3. **Sheltered investment**: Referring to securities regarded as subject to small risk by reason of their prior claim on earnings or because they rest upon an adequate taxing power.
4. **Analyst's investment**: Referring to operations that, upon thorough study, promise safety of principal and an adequate return.

These types are not mutually exclusive. A good bond, for example, would fall under all four headings.

### Types of Speculation

**Intelligent** and **Unintelligent** Speculation.

### Investment and Speculative Components

A proposed purchase that cannot qualify as an "analyst's investment" automatically falls into the speculative category.

### Investment Value, Speculative Value, and Intrinsic Value.

**Intrinsic Value** as defined in Chapter 1: "value justified by the facts."

Generally speaking, **it is the function of the stock market, and not of the analyst, to appraise the speculative factors in a given common-stock picture.**

To this important extent **the market, not the analyst, determines intrinsic value.**
