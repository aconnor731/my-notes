# Lecture 1: The Titans in Greek Mythology

First, **Chaos**.

Then from it, 3 beings:

- Earth (Gaia)
- Tartarus (underworld)
- Eros (sexual desire)

**Myth**: A story that has meaning or significance beyond the story itself.

- at its foundation, it is story telling, that provide explanations to cultural elements

**Uranus (Uur-ah-nos):** father of Titans

- didn't like them, put them in Tartarus, like shoving back into the womb
- **Kronos hated this, and with the help of his mother, he castrates Uranus**

The story of father-son conflict is more frequent in Greek mythology.

- sons wanting to supplant the fathers
- fathers rejecting their sons, sons murdering their fathers

Kronos then settles down with his sister, **Rhea**

- not uncommon in upper-class Greek culture
- this mirrors social reality

- their children created the most famous gods, the Olympian gods that ruled over the Earth
- first race of humans lived here
  - men lived like gods
  - the Golden age to Hesiod

Kronos worried his children would do the same as he did to his father.

- he eats, swallows his own children
- Zeus, youngest child, Rhea tricks Kronos with a stone and hid Zeus on the island of Crete

Zeus returns and forces Kronos to regurgitate his siblings.

They joined him in an attack against Kronos and the other titans.

- lasted 10 years
- every version, Zeus ultimately triumphs
- Zeus, put the titans back into Tartarus

Plato: human body is titanic in nature with their soul divine

**Humanity contains some Titanic element that is at war with other elements within us.**

The flowering of Greek mythology took place during the **Archaic and Classical periods: c. 700-323 BCE** (when Alexander the Great died)

- formed their own alphabet and city-states

For hundreds of years, Greek life meant conflict, which is reflected in their mythology.

**Orphic material: Poems and hymns dating from end of 6th century BCE and later**

- attributed to a mythical poet named Orpheus, but scholars argue there were multiple poets that attributed their work to the name Orpheus

**Orpheus**: Hero with superhuman musical talents who tried to rescue his wife from the underworld

- one ancient author warns his poetry is strange for people

- his war of the Titans is a little different than Hesiod's

Ancient Greeks thought themselves not as Greek, but as Athenians, Spartans, etc.

**Greek mythology was meant to be instructive.**

- Titans represented forces of nature: wind, sea, storms
- The defeat of the Titans mythologized humanity's ability to harness/capture those forces

**Greek mythology also taught geography.**

**Humanity is not born into a blank slate, more Act 2 of a play.**

- Existential Declaration

**Myths are not primarily informational; they are meant to be transformational.**
