## Week 3 / Lecture 1: Sparta - Conquest

Moving to the southern Greece to the Peloponnese to one of the most important polis of the day: **Sparta**

Sparta comes with a warning label: it was unique

The way it defined itself was very different.

Sparta was not totally separated from the rest of the Greek world.

The aspect of equality was more honored in the breech rather than the observance of equality.

Tyrtareus, a poet, spokesman for a kind of Spartan value.

- like Homer, Tyrtereus, was applied to a number of different poems that were attributed to one

Originally, Sparta was four straggling unwalled villages: "Our men are our walls."

- took advantage of their location, which is on the Eurotas River, a swift flowing cold stream that begins in the mountains of Arcadia and flows down to the sea.
  - Sparta had access to clean water
- also, Sparta located between two mountain ranges
  - a beautifully defensible location
  - controlled access to the entire region in the Southern Peloponnese



- in Homer, Sparta is the home of Menelaus and Helen
- in the Trojan war, the Spartans contribute a large contingent, but by no means the largest
  - part of the generalized Achaean community
- Sparta in the Dark Ages and in the early Archaic Age was really no different from the other Greek communities of the time.



- Sparta's remains are fairly meager:
  - Thucydides, the historian said, that if people found the ruins of Athens, they would think that the Athenians were much more powerful than they actually had been and Spartans much less powerful than they actually were.
- where things start to change is in the eighth century with the so called First Messenian War (740-720 BCE)
- these dates are very approximate
- First Messenian War CA. 740-720 BCE
- foundation of Taras CA. 710
- Defeat of Spartan invading force by argives at Hysiae CA. 670
