# Lecture 5: Romeo and Juliet: Words, Words, Words

- Shakespeare's plays are made of words
- Shakespeare's first great tragedy: Romeo and Juliet

- the most fundamental tool: **Words, words, words**
- remember the very first tool of the course: **Start with a scene**
  - dramatic expressions of character and meaning
- Romeo and Juliet is the greatest example of Shakespeare's mastery of the English language
  - this kick starts a wonderful line of masterpieces
- we see the shift of a good renaissance playwright to the greatest playwright in human history
- **Chorus: gives away the play's plot**
- **The play explores the ways in which a playwright can use words**
- **Tragedies begin with minor characters first**
  - This is true for:
    - King Lear
    - Hamlet
    - Othello
  - often characters of the lower class
    - **lower class speeches are much harder to understand**
    - much more dependent on inside jokes, inside fashions of Shakespeare's day
- it's often easier to understand these inside jokes, lower class speeches, by watching the play
- **Low Class Characters**:
  - speak prose
- **High Class Characters**
  - speak poetry
- Richard II is one of the greatest poets in all of Shakespeare, but the common gardener understands the world better than him
- Standard rhythm of Shakespearean and all English poetry: 5 beats (**Iambic pentameter**)
- The most important thing to note is that Shakespeare alternates between prose and poetry and his poetry almost always fits in this 5 beat, down-up style, because that is the closest to how the English language is naturally spoken
  - his plays are closest to natural spoken English

- **Blank verse: unrhymed iambic pentameter**
- Romeo thinks he loves Rosaline, but mainly because she won't have sex with him
  - his language gives this away, especially when we see him speak when he first sees Juliet
- Mercucio, Romeo's friend
  - speaks to embrace his imagination rather than trying to bed a woman
- Romeo, shakes him out of his own vision
- Mercucio has this immense capacity to losing himself in his imagination
  - he overwhelms the stage
  - Shakespeare is discovering is incredible gift, and not let it outrun himself
- In Act 1, Shakespeare experiments with every type of English prose and poetry
  - he almost has it figured until he discovers **the high poetic language of true love**
  - this occurs the instant Romeo lays eyes on Juliet
  - **"Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!**
    **For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night."**
    **(Act I, Scene 5)**
- here, the poetry of love works by opposites, contrasts
  - we are meant to see the contrast
  - with Rosaline, he wanted a purely earthly physical embrace. With Juliet, he feels unworthy to even touch her
- How do they speak to one another?
  - they perform a perfect sonnet when they speak
- **Sonnet**:
  - Three quatrains: four-line sections
  - Concluding couplet: two line finale
  - **Shakespearean Sonnet**: ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG rhyme scheme
    - a dramatic form
    - 3 parts, like the comic structure: block to love, lovers seek escape, block overcome
  - **"Love-at-first-sight" poetry**
  - **Began with Petrarch in Italy**
  - **Structure, movement, with flexibility**
  - **Praise woman; express poet's suffering**
  - **Awe of beauty of poet's love**
- He wrote them in 1590s when theatres were closed due to the plague
- Sonnet #18
- The poet wants a lover who is unchanging and constant
  - "Thy eternal summer will not fade"
  - The poet has given her the gift of immortality:
    - the last two lines
- **Concluding couplet forms a summary of the poem**
- **This is central to Romeo and Juliet**
- In this play, Shakespeare discovers his genius
