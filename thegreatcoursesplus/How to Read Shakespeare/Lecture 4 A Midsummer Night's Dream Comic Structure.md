# Lecture 4: A Midsummer Night's Dream: Comic Structure

- we end previous lecture the chaotic, nightmarish scene in the forest fairy world heading into Act 3
- the third act is the pivotal point, literally the hinge, between marriage and a comic ending, or death and a tragedy
- **Pay attention to the third act of a Shakespearean play**
  - In Hamlet, to be or not to be speech, etc.
- **Act 3 is the decisive point of the play**
  - viewing a play live, the intermission will often happen right around this moment in the third play
  - next time, ask yourself, what happened?
- **Tool: Decisive Act 3**
  - can really help you understand what will happen
- helpful principle of comedy:
  - the closer the comedy approaches tragedy, the more powerful the comedic relief will be when it arrives
  - **Aristotle's Poetics discusses this**

**How does the nightmare turn into the dream?**

**How is the conflict resolved?**

Remember the **friends to lovers** tool:

From Helena to Hermia:

"Injurious Hermia! Most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspir'd, have you with these
contriv'd,
To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd,
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent
When we have chid the hasty-footed time
For parting us--O, is all forgot?
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
And will you rent our ancient love asunder
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly;
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
Though I alone do feel the injury."
(Act III, Scene 2)



Puck removes the love potion except for Demetrius, who once again loves Helena.

Puck's nursery rhyme:
"When thou waks't,
Thou tak'st
True delight
In the sight
  Of thy former lady's eye;
And the country proverb known,
That every man should take his own,
In your waking shall be shown:
Jack shall have Jill,
Nought shall go ill."
(Act III, Scene 2)

Though on the surface, Bottom is the most transformed, he has remained the same.

Oberon's and Titania's friendship and love are restored.

- **_Basanos_ or trial**
  - Greek's term *basanos*, testing, trial

The Divine Comedy

- first suffering before completed restoration

**Comedy is driven by what we call the marriage plot**.

For grasping Shakespearean comedy: **Folktale and folklore elements**

- Shakespeare had deep roots in the country, and folklore is abundant throughout his work

synesthesia: blending of the senses

Bottom has experienced a magical night of transformation:

- there is no explanation
- Titania, the fairy queen, loved him
- is there really an answer to why humans love?

Bottom speaks the wisdom of the play:

- to turn the experience into art

- there is no rational explanation to the mystery of love, to why two come together

Shakespeare's 5th act:

- at the wedding feast
- Theseus compares the lover, the lunatic, and the poet, skeptical of the fairy and mystical
  - he thinks his cool reason can comprehend all the experience that surrounds him
- but he cannot comprehend
- fairies take the stage to bless the wedding, saying they comprehend the whole while Theseus comprehends a sliver
- Hippolyta points us to the limitations to human reason
- love between humans is not subject to human power

A lot of consistency between Shakespeare's plays, despite appearances.

The importance of *Pyrasmus and Thisbe* tragic play.

- the tragedy of these two was narrowly avoided in this story

**Sensibility throughout comedy: reconciliation and forgiveness**

- not death and division

The play within the play points to the most important themes of the overall play: the sensibility of the comedy

Remember the tool: **Play within the play**

- the way in which it mirrors the larger play

The tragic story is the smaller reality, that in fact a larger **comic reality circumscribes death** and promises the blessing of future life.

**Three part Structure**:

- An obstacle
- A revolt or escape
- A return
  - reconciliation through marriage, the regeneration of the social world itself

This three-part structure seems to mirror nature:

- the moon, waning, waxing, full

This 3-part structure can help us understand how these plays bring concord from discord.

We will see how this fails in the next lectures on Romeo and Juliet.
