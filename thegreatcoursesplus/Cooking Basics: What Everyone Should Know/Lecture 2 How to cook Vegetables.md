Due to chlorophyll, takes about 7 minutes to cook vegetables like asparagus in salt water.

- more than 7 minutes, the gas inside the vegetable will rupture the cell wall, losing color and flavor

Water for cooking green vegetables should be 4-6 times the weight of the vegetable.

- helps with the **pan shock**: the sudden drop in temperature in a cooking medium when food is added

kosher salt (preferred type)

table salt

Adding salt to the water, the ionic bond between sodium and chlorine is separated, the Na<sup>+</sup> remains, and the Cl<sup>-</sup> evaporates. When we add the asparagus, since it is alkaline due to its chlorophyll, a negative charge, the water is more attracted to it and penetrates and cooks more thoroughly.

- also keeps the color of the vegetable

Grapeseed oil (high smoke point) in a pan

Saute cooking around 550 degrees

**fork tender: no audible click in the ear when eating (al dente), doesn't stick to fork)**

**Better to saute asparagus rather than boiling it**.

- **Anthocyanins**: depending on their pH, may appear red, purple, blue, or black.

**Anthoxanthins**: veggies like cauliflower

**Betaxanthins**: veggies like beets
