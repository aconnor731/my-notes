# Week 7

## 7.1: Introduction to Tragedy

- Tragedy, an entirely new genre
- Previously genres including Epics and Homeric hymns
  - these used dactelic hexameter form
- Tragedy has its own constraints and possibilities than in Epic poetry
  - much shorter time frames
  - concentrate on this crux moment, tight focus in the story
  - tragedy usually is happening in the now, present
  - real people are on stage, acting as other people (this is new to us)
  - a sense of absolute make-believe, different than Epic
  - at the time, Greeks were inventing the genre of Tragedy
  - actors are all male and they portray male and female, they wear masks, their own persona is being covered up by the masks
  - come to be in the 6th century BCE in Athens
  - come to full fruition in the 5th century BCE
  - major threesome: Aeschylus, Eurypedes, and Sophocles
  - context for Tragedy is much different than Epic and Homeric hymns
    - not aristocratic or ritualistic hymns
    - Greeks attend an outdoor theater
    - Roman amphitheaters are more stone, Greek are less extravagant
  - would attend in honor of **Dionysus**, the patron god of theater
    - he was drawn out as being the focus, a festival in his honor
  - a whole group of us Greeks would go to watch this entertainment unfold before us
  - features we notice when arriving:
    - a plain stage with plain scenery on a screen behind it
    - always a door at the middle of the back of the stage
      - we are often wondering what is happening behind the door
    - large space between the stage and the first row would have the chorus who would move around
      - the chorus would engage with the actors on stage
      - the actors would also address the audience, "Can you believe what is happening on stage?!"
      - they work back and forth with the audience and the actors on stage
  - these actors are delivering lines to display the actors they are portraying
  - choral odes are important to help explain what is happening in the play
    - are sometimes are tricky to read
    - the people who wrote them assumed you had scene a lot of these plays
  - a few people are up on stage and something really intense is happening to them
  - the atmosphere of a tragedy is like a pressure cooker (if only we could find our way out)
    - centripetal, the actors are moving towards the middle and escape is not possible
  - back and forth dialogue is a main feature in Tragedy
