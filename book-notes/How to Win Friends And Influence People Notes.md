## 6. How to Make People Like You Instantly

- "If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return - if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve."

- There is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. **The law is this: *Always make the other person feel important*.**
  - John Dewey said the desire to be important **is the deepest urge in human nature**
  - It is this urge that differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge that has been responsible for civilization itself.
- The most important precept taught by nearly all religions, dating back 2500 years ago to Zoroaster: **"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."**
- You want your friends and associates to be, as Charles Schwab put it, "hearty in their approbation and lavish in their praise." All of us want that.
- Little phrases such as "I'm sorry to trouble you," "Would you be so kind as to ---?" "Won't you please?" "Would you mind?" "Thank you" - little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life - and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.
- **Such is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere, heartfelt appreciation.**
- The life of many a person could probably be changed if only someone would make him feel important.
- **The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.**
  - Emerson said, "Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him."
- "Talk to people about themselves," said Disraeli, one of the shrewdest men who ever ruled the British Empire, "and they will listen for hours."

**<u>Principle 6</u>: Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.**
