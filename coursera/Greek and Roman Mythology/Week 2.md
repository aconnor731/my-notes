# Greek and Roman Mythology, Week 2

## 2.1 On Reading Homer, Part 2

Books 1 through 8

The beginning starts with grandeur.

This epic brings together large and grand happenings with small details that are personal.

Homer ends book one with a small grace note: the click of a door closing.

## 2.2 Telemachus' Troubles

Books 1 through 4.

Story will be told according to the thread of Telemachus.

We will learn about Odysseus' house: Ithaca and Penelope, mostly through the eyes of Telemachus.

Telemachus will teach us the negative aspects of the hero: since he is a young man (20 years old).

His father has been gone for 10 years of fighting and 10 years of wandering, not quite back yet.

In the Greek take of this, 20 years old is plenty old enough. Achilles was around this age when he was conquering on the battlefield.

Telemachus is in repose when telling us the story: not quite ready to act.

When we meet Telemachus, he is daydreaming. Athena makes contact with her in disguise. Then we jump into his head.

He is waiting for a miracle to happen, something impossible. Instead, a hero typically gets things done.

Telemachus blames what is happening on the Gods.

Telemachus says bards are not to blame, he blames Zeus.

Heroes typically do not blame the Gods for things that are happening in the world.

There is a certain kind of determinism: if Zeus wants something to happen, it happens.

Not fatalism though. Fatalism is not the stuff of Heroes.

The more engaged, the more heroic. The less engaged, the less heroic.

p. 78, Zeus says the people need to get active and take action, not sit idly and waiting for intervention from the Gods.

Telemachus needs some guidance. The help he gets is Athena disguised as a mentor, Mentees.

- Mentor comes from "Mentees," the proper name.

Athena brings Telemachus on a journey so he can kind of grow up.

Athena as a helper of youth.

Book 1: Telemachus feels sorry for himself and is daydreaming. At the end, he calls an assembly. It is a sad result. The people in the crowd feel sorry for him. They do not engage after Telemachus fulminates and gesticulates while asking them to engage.
