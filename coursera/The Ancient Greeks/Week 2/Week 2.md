## The Polis and Greeks Overseas

### Video 1

### Week 2 / Lecture 1: The *Polis*

Moving from the 3 century period, the Dark Ages, after Mycenae collapsed.

Now, we move to the Archaic Age, also a 3 century period (800 - 500 BC)

- for a very long time, it was eclipsed by the glory of the classical period in the 5th century with its temple and its plays, etc.
- Now, the Archaic Age is realized to be one of the most important formative periods in Greek history.
- So much going on with the economy, military practice, agriculture, social values, law, etc.

We see a uniquely Greek cultural identity.

- date to start looking: 776 BCE, the date of the first Olympic games
- one of the few genuine dating methods that spanned across the entire Greek world
- this is the time that Greek identity became distinct from the other Eastern Mediterranean communities

What were some of the elements?

- Homer is a defining cultural entity

- The Polis, the sort of community the Greeks adopted

  - in the Odyssey, Odysseus saw the towns and learned the minds of many different men.

    - all different communities, but all have a sort of three part division: king, council, and assembly
      - king is the leader in battle, can be the high priest and chief judge
      - the Council, often made up of elders, advisers to the King
      - the assembly is generally made up of the army

  - this is sort of the base for the development of the polis

  - The Polis:

    ![polis](./images/polis.png)

    - both on the mainland, the islands, on the coast of Asia Minor.

- Aristotle lived and wrote in the 4th Century BCE, in a time when the polis was already, as an institution, in decline.

  - we can start with his analysis

- Some Key Terms:

  - `Polis`: clumsily translated in English to "City-State"
    - two principle features: an internal unity, and an independence from communities nearby
    - **essential fact of it is that it included both the urban center and the farmland around it**
      - citizens from the farmland were had the same status of citizenry as those in downtown Athens
  - `Politeia`: incredibly complicated to describe:
    - Constitution, Citizen Body, Citizenship
  - `Polites`: someone who participates, who is an actor in the Polis, a citizen
    - No matter the Polis, the Polites were always and only native-born, free, adult male
      - women, foreigners, children, slaves were excluded from full participation in political life
  - ![map of Ancient Greece](./images/map_of_Ancient_Greece.jpg)
  - ![polis size](./images/polis-size.png)
    - the Polis varied greatly in size:
      - Attika, very large for a Polis, about 1,000 square miles
      - Sparta, in the south, with its possession of Mycenae (3,300 square miles)
      - Korintti, enormously important Polis for the entire period we will be studying, 340 square miles, some of the island communities were smaller yet

- Aristotle defines the first association of human beings as the **Household**, then they agglomerate into **Villages**, then by a process called by the great historian Louis Mumford called, an **urban implosion**, called **Synoecism**, the villages come together to form a polis.

- Urban core, sites of administrative buildings, the shrine, the market, but to repeat, it was one part of the whole of the polis

  - centered around the Acropolis

- ideology of equality underlies it all

- responsibilities and obligation towards their communities

- Aristotle thought highly of the Polis

- Polis is at the root of all the western words: politics, police, policy

- story of Theseus, the mythical king of Athens

  - his story is the myth for the creation of the polis in Athens
  - he goes to Crete and defeats the Minotaur
  - Plutarch tells us when Theseus returns to Athens, he has a great idea, combining the communities into one great community (Synoecism)
  - he sets up a temple, a common shrine, where everyone can come to worship Athena
  - he sets up games, a marker of community identity, not a trivial thing
  - also welcomed in foreigners
  - sets up a polity, a community, called Athens, citizens of Athena

- For Aristotle, the Polis is a location where human beings are meant to live

- someone who lives outside of a polis, he is either a beast or a god

- the intensity of the connection between the citizen and the city-state might be something we don't understand

- in the Archaic Age, the polis starts to be diffused

### Week 2 / Lecture 2: "The Greeks Overseas": Colonization

- around 750 to 700 BC, the polis was pretty well established
- one reason to its ascent: new type of farming, intensive
  - in the Odyssey, Odysseus visits his father Laertes on a farm like this
- Greeks started to move
  - possible reason is not having enough room for people to have these farms
- always some kind of crisis at home
- some key terms:
  - `Metropolis`: mother city
  - `Apoikia` - colony
  - `Oikistes` - the founder who set this whole community up, Theseus for example
- Mount Parnassus, the place of the temple of Apollo
  - Delphi belonged to all the Greeks, it was not under control of a single community
  - it was pan-hellenic
  - two main functions:
    - purification: murder had pollution, and it had to go to Delphi to get official purification before he could be readmitted to the community
    - prophecy: ask the priestess a question and get an answer
- pilgrimage from all over to Delphi
- before going to Delphi you would leave a small offering to your local shrine
- people would talk about what was happening in their local community
- to start a community you had to go to Delphi first to get approval (example, founding of Cyrene in Africa)
- two great waves of Greek colonization:
  - first in the mid-8th century in the west to Italy and Sicily
  - second in the Northeast towards the Black Sea
- these were organized shifts of migration
- the colonization movement began in the West
- the first colony was in the bay of Naples
  - why would they travel so far? **Iron**
  - Greeks were inclined to travel enormous distance to acquire it
- **Nestor's Cup**:
  - some of the earliest inscribed Greek writing on it
- the Greeks discovered writing again, no longer Linear-B, the clumsy 87 character syllabary, but in the form of the 24 character alphabet, borrowed from the Phoenicians, that is the foundation of most modern alphabets
- next? Colonies are established all of the Greek area
- Criteria to form a new area:
  - defensible
  - good airable land
  - natural resources
  - accessibility to trade
- Remember Odysseus scouting Cyclops' island thinking it would be a good place to set up a community
- Cyrene
  - from Herodotus
- in almost all colonial narratives, in the mother city, there is some kind of crisis, trouble
- for Cyrene, the mother city is Thera, a little island in the Cyclides
- they have a drought
- they get a prophecy to Delphi and they dodge it
- they go back to the prophet at Delphi and he reiterates to set up a colony in Libya
- they finally do, the drought ends, Battis is honored for starting it
- **unlike colonialism in the West, these colonies were not dependent on their mother city**
  - they were intended to be an autonomous, independent city
- nothing like the New World colonies that were established by the European colonies
- we are seeing the spread of `polis`, the Hellenization of the Mediterranean
- Greek influence was making itself felt far and wide

### Week 2 / Lecture 3: Literacy, Lawgivers and Law Codes

- explosion of activity that characterized the Archaic Age:
  - Homer
  - the establishment of the polis as an institution
  - polis spread through colonization
  - recovered literacy
- Minoan and Mycenaeans were literate with Linear-A and Linear-B, but it was restricted to a very small group of people: scribes who took noted the inventory
- Greeks rediscovered literacy from the alphabet of the Phoenicians
  - still far away from universal literacy, but still much more widespread
  - it was used to create a new kind of poetry
  - it was also used to record law
- in the Dark Ages, a class of people grew called themselves "The Good People," the "**Agathoi**"
  - hereditary landowners
  - had the best flocks, the best land, the most wealth, etc.
- Hesiod complains about the "bribe devouring lords" who deprived him of his inheritance.
- These bribe-devouring Lords came to be challenged by law-givers, like the great Athenian law-giver Solon.
- **some key terms**:
  - **Nomos**:
    - almost undefinable complexity
    - means law, but more specifically, law sanctioned by long usage, custom
    - the way that communities, cities, cultures define themselves
  - **Eunomia**:
    - having good laws and well-obeyed, lawfulness
- What is it that gave rise to the codification of law to writing these things down?
  - part of it is the polis ideology: ideologically equal citizens with equal claim to the law
  - economic and social stress with new standards wealth
  - almost certainly due to colonization due to these organized dispension of groups of people
- some of these places had settlers from different mother cities, they had to find a way to harmonize
- he worked on the "figure of the law-giver"
  - very, very important
  - historical and legendary figures of law-givers
    - their stories fall into a common pattern
- some kind of crisis in the home state
- the old customs aren't working well enough to hold this in check
- the community chooses one man who is virtuous, uniquely able to create a good code
  - Solon "traveled widely", like Odysseus he saw the towns and learned the minds of many different men
  - gave him great perspective to create a code that works
- he establishes a code that everyone can appeal to
- the story typically includes some kind of challenge to the code that has to be overcome
- very often, it involves the law-giver himself transgressing one of his own laws
  - one example, in Sicily, he broke the law by forgetting to leave his dagger outside of the assembly, he did not exempt himself and instead murdered himself
- this leads us to the next part of this: these stories almost always include the death or the departure of the lawgiver
  - because as long as he is around, he retains his ability, potentially, to change his own code
  - in other words, the ideology that the law is superior to the individual
    - like Aristotle saying the polis is greater than the individual
- Solon and Lycurgus of Sparta, two lawgivers
- also seeing the replacement of clan-based, individual-based justice, from the "bribe-devouring lords" for instance, with a justice that can apply to all members of a community: **good laws well obeyed**
- earliest law codes found at Gortes, in Southern Crete, "code of Gorton"
  - is read left to right, then the next line is from right to left
  - is later than the period we are talking about, around 500
  - is exemplary of these early codes, if it elevates a character of a community, you know it is a fake
  - criminal laws and laws that include who can write a will
  - don't think of these as good models of enlightened thinking, instead think of them as a good example of **order** that defines a community: from an individual, clan-based justice to one that applies to all in the community
- another great change in the Archaic Age: **laws of War**

### Week 2 / Lecture 4: The Works of Ares: Hoplite Warfare

- hoplites were foot soldiers in the wealthier city-states of seventh century B.C. Greece.
  - were often praised in art of the time due to their military service as a primary distinction of citizenship
  - a mark of status and often of wealth as well as a means of attaining glory
  - the initiatives to standardize the Homeric epics in written form fostered a broader interest in heroic subject matter.
- Solon filtered citizens into the military based on their class status, split into four classes
- the hoplites were the second from the top and their phalanx remained the most important fighting unit for centuries
- many changes including economic
- wealth was defined by as Hesiod said, "the corn in one's barn," agriculture, land ownership passed to land
- new form of wealth emerged, **movable wealth**
- tokens from clans, metal, coinage
- no longer land ownership, now it is a bag of gold
- new middle class, not bourgeoise
  - between the Agathoi of old, and the people just barely subsisting
- also, a change in military tactics
- in Iliad, a mass of anonymous fighters among the heroes
- the hoplite reform
- hoplite:
  - heavily armed soldier in tight formation to provide protect the guy on your left whose right side is holding the spear and is unprotected
  - new kind of class:
    - the farmers, with their intensively worked private land
    - setting aside new form of wealth to purchase this armor
    - helmet, breast plate, 1 meter diameter shield, short stabbing spear, some kind of corset, shin guards
    - shield would be wooden frame with bronze covering it, more for display than protection
  - the ideal in combat was to maintain your place in line
  - whichever line broke first would be defeated
  - injuries were horrific, below the shield, groin, or above, with the neck
  - battles could last very long time, after the winners would allow the losers to collect their dead
- new kind of structure in many different sorts of ways:
  - polis
  - lawgivers and law codes, equanamity
  - line in battles as well, communities defending themselves
    - Homeric heroism does not have much space
    - "stand firm," "maintain your place"
- the ideology of the hoplite: **defending himself and his community**
- in the Greek polis, there was no professional bureaucracy nor professional army, farmers would return to their farm
- Marx - "All that is solid melts to the air"



"Of all things it is poverty that most subdues a noble man,
More even than hoary old age, Kyrnos, or fever;
Indeed, to avoid it one should even throw oneself into the sea's
Deep gulfs, Kyrnos, or off sheer cliffs.
For the man subdued by poverty can neither say
Nor do anything, because his tongue is tied." - **Theognis**

"The noblest thing is justice; the most advantageous, health;
But what gives greatest delight is to gain the object of one's desire." - **Theognis**

## Week 2 / Lecture 5: New Voices - The Lyric Poets

- the sudden effusion of appearance of poetry where people are saying "I":

  - I fear, I think...

- this characterized the Archaic Age

- subtle and supple Homeric meter

- but for lyric poetry, you have much more rhythmic

- people were singing songs and composing poetry that weren't epics long before the Archaic Age

-  what changes now, is the appearance of writing

- the poets have the ability now to record their poems in written text

- Apollo, especially an association with poetry

- it is also a public performance

- now have female voices, Sappho especially

- the "I", the individual, is there

- these poems reflect cultural values and issues

- one of the earliest, often identified as the earliest, and greatest: **Archilochus** (early 7<sup>th</sup> century)

  - he tells us in his verse he is originally from Paros

  - then moved to the north Aegean island of Thasos, a place he hated

  - he was a warrior:

    ```
    I am servant of Enyalios the battle lord,
    and of the Muses also, understanding their lovely gift.
    ```

    - Enyalios (Ares)

  - he ditches his shield, "To hell with it. I can get another." Imagine Achilles doing that.

  - new hoplite combat and also a reflection of social tensions

  - many of his verses are erotic

    - ```
      30, 31. She rejoiced, holding a branch of myrtle
      And the rose-tree's lovely flower...
      And her hair shadowed her shoulders and her back.
      ```

    - ```
      201. The fox knows many things, the hedgehog only one - a big one.
      ```

- another poet, very renowned, **Theognis** (Megara - 6<sup>th</sup> century)

  - many verses attributed to him cannot be authentic because he did not live through what he claims he did

  - much of his songs speak about the dramatically shifting of the social, economic, and legal circumstances of his day

  - the persona he adopts here, a part of the Agathos, the elite, whose priviledges are being infringed

  - some are addressed to a young man, Kyrnos:

    ```
    L. 53 FF. Kyrnos, this city is still a city, but its people now are different,
    Being those who earlier knew neither judgments nor laws,
    But instead wore goatskins to tatters about their sides
    And grazed like deer outside of this city.
    And now they are noble, son of Polypaos, while those who before had merit
    Now are worthless. Who could endure to look upon these things?
    ```

  - also talks about eugenics:

    ```
    L. 183 FF. Among rams and asses and horses, Kyrnos, we look for those
    Of noble breeding, and a man wants them to mate
    From a worthy stock. Yet a noble man does not mind marrying
    A base woman of base birth if she brings him money in abundance,
    Nor does a woman shrink from becoming the wife of a base man
    With wealth; she prefers a rich husband to a worthy one.
    Money is what they honor.
    ```

    - this differs from Archilocus

- two of the greatest of the ancient lyric poets lived about at the same time, in the same place: Alceus and Sappho

  - both came from an island called Lesbos

  - Sappho is the first true female voice whom we hear

    - the subject of so many visions and revisions because of her account of emotion of love and desire

    - her poems, even in fragmented form, is powerful:

    - **Sapphos** - late 7<sup>th</sup> century

      ```
      16. Some say a host of horsemen is the most beautiful thing
      On the black Earth, some say a host of foot-soldiers
      Some, a fleet of ships; but I say it is
      Whatever one loves.
      Wholly easy it is to make this intelligible
      To everyone, for she who by far surpassed
      All humankind in beauty, Helen,
      Forsook her husband,
      Noblest of men, to sail away to Troy;
      Neither of child nor of beloved parents
      Did she take thought at all, being led astray by...
      ....
      ...Now has brought Anaktoria to my mind,
      Though she is absent:
      I would rather see her lovely step
      And the glancing brightness of her face
      Than Lydian chariots and foot soldiers
      Arrayed in armor.
      ```

  - Sapphos' great contemporary, but lesser known poet, Alcaeus

  - Alcaeus, Mytilene - late 7<sup>th</sup> century:

    - he writes about any number of different topics:

      - the pleasure of socializing over wine
      - the fear of battle

    - he was the first to use the metaphor of the ship of state:

      - the ship is beset by a storm and the crewmen are scared:

        ```
        Now let every man prove himself reliable,
        And let us not put to shame by cowardice
        Our noble fathers lying under the Earth...
        ```

        - gives honor to those who have gone before us
