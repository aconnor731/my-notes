# Lecture 3: A Midsummer Night's Dream: Comic Tools

Where did Shakespeare get his plots?

- out of 38 plays he wrote, only 1 or 2 of them seemed to have a original plot

Shakespeare was not a great creator of original stories.

Shakespeare, as a boy, studied the classic Roman Latin writers: Plautus and Terence.

- one way they would teach Latin would be to read and perform the plays by Plautus and Terence

One of his first plays, **The Comedy of Errors** is based on one of Plautus' plays.

The comic form he inherited:

- *comos*: Greek word, means "revelry" or "merrymaking"
  - **comedy and marriage are always connected**

The Roman playwrights that Shakespeare studied created a new form of comedy called New Comedy:

**New Comedy Three-Part Structure**:

1. Young love is blocked
   1. s*enex iratus*: angry old man
2. Lovers seek escape
   1. comic confusion
3. Block overcome
   1. order restored

**The key thing is the <u>initial block to young love.</u>**

Like today's romantic comedys:

1. Boy gets girl
2. Boy loses girl
3. Boy gets girl back

Shakespeare's first great comedy was probably *A Midsummer Night's Dream*.

- angry father (*senex iratus*) Egeus with his daughter Hermia for her wanting to wed Lysander instead of his chosen suitor, Demetrius
- part of the humor of the play is that Demetrius and Lysander are quite similar
- Hermia and Helena are friends

What so angers Egeus is the issue of disobedience, a matter that fascinates Shakespeare: the efforts of the old to control the young and particularly of fathers to control their daughters.

This may have been a matter of personal concern: Shakespeare had two surviving children, both girls, and the difficulty of controlling a young woman, as his early comedy *The Taming of the Shrew* also demonstrates, is a constant obsession of his.

In *Romeo and Juliet*, Shakespeare wrote of the tragic inability of young lovers to overcome the block to their love.

In *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, Shakespeare will write their comic solution.

**Second tool: the Altar or the tomb?**

- If altar, it's a comedy
- If tomb, it's a tragedy

**Third important tool for understanding Shakespearean comedy: the friends to lovers tool.**

- What is lost in this movement from friendship to romantic love, and what is gained?
- Hermia and Helena are great childhood friends and tells her of her plan to flee to the forest with Lysander
  - Helena, who Demetrius once loved and now scorns
  - Helena tells Demetrius, and she rather would receive his scorn and abuse than loveless solitude

In his comedies, same-sex friendship, whether male or female, gives way to heterosexual love, which seems a necessary, though painful, shift.

**High plot: involves upper class**

**Low plot: involves lower class, those Shakespeare was more familiar with**

- often in his plays, the greatest wisdom comes from these people at the bottom of the social world
- always mirror the high plot

These mechanicals, of the low plot, don't know what they are doing with their play.

*Pyrasmus and Thisbe*: merry and tragic?

- **A very good statement of what this play, and all Shakespearean comedy, seeks to do: to find the concord out of discord.**

Bottom is the chief actor, one of Shakespeare's great characters.

- he wants to play all the characters

**The final tool for this lecture: the green world tool**

- This flight into nature is a standard device in Shakespearean comedy, and in this play, we see the range of meanings that Shakespeare attaches to this green world.
- It is far more than just an escape from the city.
- There are a whole range of oppositions that Shakespeare suggests between the world of Athens and that of the forest.

Again, the double plots mirror and comment upon each other. The lovers enter the forest and experience confusion, particularly of their identities and of love.

Shakespeare then deepens the issues by using the comedy to pursue the very meaning of love. To him, love is independent of sight. It is a kind of magical madness.

Act 2 starts in the forest, with fairies.

- Shakespeare introduces a third plot line, where Elizabethen comics would have been satisfied with just the two
- Puck, this mischievous sprite who delights in misleading travelers, tripping up old women, and frightening maidens
- these fairies are drawn from English folklore, Celtic mythology
  - from "abandoned belief"
- Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, will not abide each other's company
- Oberon wants Titania to give him a changeling boy, whom she refuses
- a battle of wills between man and woman, not unlike Theseus and Hippolyta, Egeus and Hermia
  - the parallels in Shakespeare's plots are so important
- Titania's explanation for not giving the boy is telling:
  - his mother was a votress of my order
  - describes marvelous adventures they shared
  - since she was mortal, she died and she is loyal to her to raise her child
- She is loyal to her friend

**To understand one plot line, we must understand all the others.**

The chaos in nature and in the human world is caused by the dissension in the spiritual.

- an eloquent expression of the idea that all the levels of life need to be harmonized for the creation to thrive

**The entire cosmos is threatened by the blocks of love that open this play.**

- he is giving it a philosophical depth, enriching the comic structure

**The green world tool**:

| The City                   | The Green World                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Reason, judgment           | Dream, imagination                           |
| Law, order                 | Chaos, love, eroticism                       |
| Human world, Theseus rules | Nature, supernatural, where the fairies rule |

Residing in just one of these worlds is a sterile harsh life

- love without restraint is madness
- law without love is a sterile harsh life

The tragedies show the failure to balance these

Shakespeare explores the very meaning of love:

- using the eyes
- "love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind and therefor is winged Cupid painted blind"
  - **Imaginary forces**
- love potion is applied to the eyes:
  - "The juice of it, on sleeping eyelids laid
    Will make or man or woman madly dote
    Upon the next live creature that it sees."
- the love potion mocks the very power of the eyes
- **love is a kind of magical madness**

Puck transforms Bottom's head into a donkey's head, ass.

- who he is inside is now represented on the outside

When Titania awakes from her midnight slumber, she sees Bottom, the lowest person of the human world, praising his song (the hee-hawing of a donkey lol)

- it pushes this blind love motif to its 
- he portrays the highest fairy, the queen, enslaved to the lowest serf, Bottom

Shakespeare is interested in the radical potential of the theatre.
