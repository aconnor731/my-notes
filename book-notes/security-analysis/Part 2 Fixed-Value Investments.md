# Part 2: Fixed-Value Investments

### Introduction to Part 2: Unshackling Bonds by Howard S. Marks

In 1965, the early days, common stock investors reference the  Dow Jones Industrial Average, not the S&P 500, and there was no talk of quartiles or deciles.

Hedge funds had not been invented yet.

The 1940 edition of *Security Analysis* marks an interesting turn toward what we would consider very modern thinking--it references some absolute standards but dismisses many others and reflects an advanced attitude toward sensible fixed income investing.

### Investment Absolutes

When Howard bean to manage high yield bonds in 1978, most institutional portfolios were governed by rules that limited bond holdings to either "investment grade" (triple B or better) or "A or better."

### Investment versus Speculation

Something occurred to him as he was re-reading the 1940 edition as Graham and Dodd were saying on thing and he was reading another: they didn't mean that something shouldn't be bought--**but rather that it shouldn't be bought, to use their phrase, "on an investment basis."**

**Securities qualified for investment on the basis of quality, not prospective return.**

A more modern attitude would be based on the notion that virtually any asset can be a good investment if bought knowledgeably and at a low-enough price. The opposite is also Howard sees as true: **there's no asset so good that it can't be a bad investment if bought too high a price.**

Everyone now realizes that membership on a list of "acceptable investments" certainly doesn't provide protection against loss. I.e., look at the bonds that were rated AAA a few decades ago or mortgage-backed securities that went from AAA to junk status in 2007.

A principle developed in *Security Analysis*: "a high coupon rate is not adequate compensation for the assumption of substantial risk of principal." (p. 125 on accompanying CD)

A more thorough reading, however, shows that securities that the authors say should not be purchased "on an investment basis" can still be considered "for speculation."

### Investment Realism

It is clear that Graham and Dodd are insistent on **substance over form**, and on **logic rather than rules**.

- it's how likely a bond is to pay that matters, not what it is labeled
- credit standards must not be fixed but instead must evolve
- safer bonds are not necessarily better buys than their juniors
- superior yield can render riskier issues more attractive

### Our Methodology for Bond Investing

The key to success lies in avoiding losers, not in searching for winners.

1. *Our entire approach is based on recognition of the asymmetry that underlies all nondistressed bond investing.*

Graham and Dodd note:
"Instead of associating bonds primarily with the presumption of *safety*--as has long been the practice--it would be sounder to start with what is not presumption but fact, *viz*., that a (straight) bond is an investment with *limited return*..."

Bond selection is primarily a negative art. **It is a process of exclusion and rejection, rather than of search and acceptance.** (p. 143)

2. *Our high yield bond portfolios are focused.*
   1. Essentially, bond selection should consist of working upward from definite minimum standards rather than working downward in haphazard fashion from some ideal but unacceptable level of maximum security. (pp. 167-168)
3. *Credit risk stems primarily from the quantum of leverage and the firm's basic instability, the interaction of which in tough times can erode the margin by which interest coverage exceeds debt service requirements.*
   1. A company with very stable cash flows can support high leverage and a heavy debt service.
   2. The combination of high leverage and undependable cash flow can result in a failure to service debt.
4. *Analysis of individual issues calls for a multifaceted approach.*
   1. *On company standing*: "The experience of the past decade indicates that dominant or at least substantial size affords an element of protection against the hazards of instability." (p. 178)
   2. *On interest coverage*: "The present-day investor is accustomed to regard the ratio of earnings to interest charges as the most important specific test of safety." (p. 128 on accompanying CD)
   3. *On capital structure*: "The biggest company bay be the weakest if its bonded debt is disproportionately large." (p. 179)
5. *"There are no permanent investments."* (p. 253)
6. *Don't engage in market timing based on interest rate forecasts.*
7. *Despite our best efforts, defaults will creep into our portfolios, whether due to failings in credit analysis or bad luck.*

### Common Sense

Graham and Dodd remind us in the end, "Investment theory should be chary of easy generalizations." (p. 171)

### Security Analysis through the Years

- "an investor may reject any number of good bonds with virtually no penalty at all" (p. 143)
  - comparison Warren Buffet made was a batter in baseball. **A baseball hitter will be called out if he fails to swing at three pitches in the strike zone, while an investor can let any number of investment opportunities go by without being penalized.**
- Importantly, Graham and Dodd highlight the importance of cash flow stability in a company's ability to service its debts in an adverse environment.
  - Of course, like all important investment principles, this one is often ignored in bullish periods; enthusiasm and optimism gain sway and the stable-cash-flow rule can be easily forgotten.

### A Few More Thoughts

First, most of the timing that interested Graham and Dodd concerned **"depressions" and their impact on creditworthiness.** They cite three depressions--1920 to 1922, 1930 to 1933, and 1937 to 1938--whereas we talk today about there having been only one in this century: the Great Depression.

Clearly, Graham and Dodd are talking about what we call "recessions."

**Second, they were not concerned with predicting interest-rate fluctuations.**

**Third, it is important to note that several of Graham and Dodd's warnings against risk taking are directed not at professionals but at the individual investors who appear to have been the authors' target audience.**

He would also not differ with the proposition that direct investment in distressed debt and high yield bonds should be left to professionals.

### Into the Future

Graham and Dodd's wisdom is pretty timeless, as their discussion of mortgage investing still greatly applies to today in light of the subprime and collateralized debt obligation (CDO) experience of 2007:
"During the great and disastrous development of the real estate mortgage-bond business between 1923 and 1929, the only datum customarily presented to support the usual bond offering—aside from an estimate of future earnings—was a statement of the **appraised value of the property**, which almost invariably amounted to some 66 % in excess of the mortgage issue. If these appraisals had corresponded to the market values which experienced buyers of or lenders on real estate would place upon the properties, they would have been of real utility in the selection of sound real estate bonds. But unfortunately they were purely artificial valuations, to which the appraisers were willing to attach their names for a fee, and whose only function was to deceive the investor as to the protection which he was receiving…. This whole scheme of real estate financing was honeycombed with the most glaring weaknesses, and it is sad commentary on the lack of principle, penetration, and ordinary common sense on the part of all parties concerned that it was permitted to reach such gigantic proportions before the inevitable collapse. (p. 185)"

**Paid-for home appraisals (and security ratings) that led to undeserved confidence--and thus uninformed risk bearing--on the part of unknowing investors: what could better describe recent events?**
