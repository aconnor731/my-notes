# Lecture 4: Production and Stagecraft

## By Elizabeth Vandiver, Phd

At first, only **one actor**: **Thespis** (fl. 534 B.C.)

Two actors: **Aeschylus** (c. 525-456 B.C.)

Three actors: **Sophocles** (496-406 B.C.)

Only ever three actors in Greek tragedy

- all male
- three actors played all roles (more than 3 roles typically)
- great female characters were played by men (same in Shakespeare's plays)
- masks were used

Greek Tragedy also used a **chorus**:

- also used masks
- probably 12 members, not sure
- comprised of common people
- take no direct part in the action of a Greek Tragedy, they comment on the action
- would tell us important information to understand the situations the characters are facing
- parallels are drawn on classic mythology
  - often very obscure to modern readers
  - often have no idea what the chorus is talking about, but the audience at the time probably knew what they were talking about
- word chorus comes from a Greek word meaning "dance"
- chorus danced and the chorus sang
- **aulos**--double-reeded wind instrument accompanying the chorus
- we can't recover the music and choreography of chorus from tragedy
- Order of chorus:
  - First, **Prologue**: backstory, time and place, who is involved
    - occasionally, it is omitted
  - Second, **Parados**: chorus' entrance, anywhere from 20 to 200 lines in length
    - establishes the chorus' identity, comprised of older men, etc.
  - Third, **Epeisodia**: dialogue between two or three actors or the chorus and actors
    - episodes are further divided into **stasima** ("standing song") or **stasimon**
      - distinguishes choral songs
      - divided into **strophes** and **antistrophes**
        - antistrophe is exactly metrically equivalent to its strophe
        - think of the dancing, the choreography, i.e., probably similar
  - Final, the **Exodos**, the chorus leaves
    - gives the moral of the story, a summary
- the meters of the chorus' songs are varied and complicated
  - distinguished from the actors' spoken song
- **rhesis**: actor talks for several lines
- **stichomythia**: rapid fire between actors, one line, often interrupting each other
- **argos**: exchanges break down into stichomythia debating some point at issue
- **monody**: a song or lyric by a single actor
- most important: **the messenger speech**, things that happened off-stage are explained
  - most climactic point is explained by messenger, Oedipus the King, Jocasta kills herself, explained by the messenger
- remaining element, lumped together under **stagecraft**
- 12,000 to 17,000 in the theater of Dionysus
- without facial expression, voice and gesture were most important
- vase painting is the best way for us to see what the theater was like
- no artificial lighting, sound effects, scenery
  - performed during the day
- **skenographia**: scratching or writing on the **skene**
  - Aristotle most likely did not mean moveable sets and such
- **ekkyklema**: wheeled device to represent a scene happening inside the skene
