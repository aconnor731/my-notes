# The Odyssey Book Summaries

## Book 1



## Book 2: Telemachus sets Sail

Athena encourages Telemachus to journey to Pylos to find Odysseus. Telemachus condemns the ruffians/suitors who are ravaging his household's wealth as they say they are all waiting to marry his widowed mother, Penelope. Telemachus agrees with Athena to go on this journey and Athena gathers a ship and a crew to prepare for the voyage.



## Book 3: King Nestor Remembers

Line 18: Athena says to Telemachus, "Telemachus, no more shyness, this is not the time!"

Telemachus arrives at King Nestor's magnificent coastal city of Pylios. Telemachus is awestruck from the grandeur at what he sees here. 9 groups of 500 people, each slaughtering 9 bulls. The opulence and display of wealth is extraordinary.

King Nestor of Pylios fought with King Odysseus at Troy.

- he does not know what happened to his father, Odysseus, because half of the forces at Troy stayed behind while the other half fled.

Orestes killed Aegisthus (his mother and Agamemnon's wife), who'd killed his famous father Agamemnon.

The book finishes with King Nestor's sons accompanying Telemachus on horseback across the landscape of Pylios towards his destination. Athena had left a few days before.

- also being schooled using historical lessons (you think you have it bad, look at this story of this person)
- they hint at taking action for himself

Aegisthus and her liason/lover conspired and killed King Agamemnon upon his return from Troy. Aegisthus has most of the responsibility of Agamemnon's death, according to Homer.



### Book 4: The King and Queen of Sparta

Telemachus visits the grandeur and nostalgia of Sparta to speak with King Menelaus and Helen.

The citadels in Sparta were truly magnificent. They thought only a cyclops could build these structures. The impulse to look at your ancestors as being greater begins to show here.

Helen brings in a bowl some wine mixed in with some narcotics she received in Egypt.

- she can bring you out of this world
- a magical and powerful aura
- Homer sees tremendous power of these qualities

Proteus of Egypt, the immortal Old Man of the Sea who never lies, who is Poseidon's servant.

Proteus explains to Menelaus that the nymph Calypso is holding Odysseus captive by force in her house. He has no way of returning home. No ship or crew.

Proteus says on line 640 that the gods count *him* the son-in-law of Zeus because he is Helen's husband.

The book finishes with some of the Achaean suitors/ruffians waiting in hiding with their ships inside a cove between Ithaca and Asteris to ambush and kill Telemachus. His mother, Icarius' daughter, Penelope, learns of this plot and is overwhelmed with sorrow and fear for her boy. Pallas Athena sends a spirit to comfort her where she tells her it is decreed that he will live.
