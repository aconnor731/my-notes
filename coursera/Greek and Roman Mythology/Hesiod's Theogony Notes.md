# Hesiod's Theogony Notes

- Earth (Gaia)
- Sky (Ouranos)
- Sea (Pontos)
  - they are not mere elements, but gods.

The *Theogony* is partly a cosmogony, that is, a poem not only about the birth of the gods and the various divine powers but also about the birth of the multifarious divine universe.

The most familiar type of theogonic literature-in the Hesiodic sense-comes to use from the opening chapters of Genesis.

#### The Kumarbi from Hittite texts and Hurrian origin

The story of Kumarbi comes to us in Hittite texts but is doubtless of Hurrian origin.

In one text, the sky-god Anu defeated Alalu and forced him to flee to the earth.

After Anu reigned in the sky for nine years, he was threatened by Kumarbi and fled up to his own element, the sky, but Kumarbi pursued him, caught him, and then bit off and swallowed his genitals.

The river Tigris and the god Tasmisu are born from what Kumarbi disgorges when warned by Anu about the potential danger from "the three gods" he has swallowed.

But the third god is still inside him.

With the aid of a fabulous emetic and after considerable travail, his body is rid of the third god, who turns out to be the weather-god.

What follows is fragmentary and very unclear, but in a longer text call the *Song of Ullikumni*, Kumarbi gives birth to a mighty child of monstrous size.

This child eventually threatens all the gods, but his feet are cut off and he is finally subdued by the gods.

#### The Babylonian En&ucirc;ma Eli&scaron;

antedate: precede in time; come before (something) in time

It antedates the *Theogony* by as much as five hundred years.

Details do differ, and the Hittite-Hurrian story may in some ways, especially in the castration motif, be somewhat closer to the Hesiodic account, but both the Hittite-Hurrian and the Babylonian theogonies show, in overall terms and patterns, an astounding similarity to the Hesiodic *Theogony*.

#### Norse

In the final battle of the gods (*Ragnar&ouml;k) Thor kills the serpent, even if he is overcome by its venom.

That the ruling gods and men will perish in a final blaze after the dread confrontation of gods and monsters is an element eschatologically so reminiscent of Judaeo-Christian doomsday beliefs that we should, at least tentatively, assume in this account the probability of extraneous influence.

----

Much like Homer's epics, Hesiod's *Theogony* must stand not at the beginning but at the apex of a tradition.

First Olympian generation: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus.
