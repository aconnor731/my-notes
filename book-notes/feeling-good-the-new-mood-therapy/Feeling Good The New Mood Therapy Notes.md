# Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy Notes

A **cognition**: a thought or perception.

Proverbs 23:7 - "For as he thinks within himself, so he is."

"For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so" - *Hamlet*, Act 2, Scene 2

Based on findings from a research study, Dr. Antonuccio and his coauthors concluded that psychotherapy should be considered a second-rate treatment but should usually be the **initial treatment for depression**.

Bibliotherapy: reading therapy (simply reading a good self-help book like *Feeling Good* without any other therapy)

- Dr. Forest Scogin and his colleagues at the University of Alabama found this to be as effective as a full course of psychotherapy or treatment with the best antidepressant drugs (Initially published in the prestigious *Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology* and in *The Gerontologist*)

Studies of conventional cognitive therapy and medication-based therapy in comparison with bibliotherapy have shown that bibliotherapy works just as well in a shorter period of time (4 weeks compared to 12 weeks).

This shows that **you can defeat depression by changing the negative thinking patterns that cause it.**
