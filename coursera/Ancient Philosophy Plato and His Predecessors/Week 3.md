# Week 3

## Part 2, Lecture 17: Virtue in the Meno

Can virtue be taught?

In Plato's Apology, Socrates denies ever being a teacher.

Greek word for **virtue**: *aret&#275;*

- means *excellence* or *greatness*
- encompasses everything you aspire to yourself, not just what you admire in another
- be all you can be

The young men are ambitious and want to be good politicians like **Themistocles** (582-462 BCE) and **Pericles** (459-429 BCE) and their virtues. They seek aret&#275;Â in this form, of the greatness of the past.

- they are like those who want to run for President, for power, for leadership

**Meno**: "Well, what else [is virtue] than to be able to rule people?" (Meno 73d)

How does one come to be as wise as Pericles or Themistocles and how can we cultivate it in future generations?

## Part 2, Lecture 18: Teachers of Virtue?

**Meno** treats virtue as the ability to be a great, wise, and capable leader like Pericles or Themistocles.

Can virtue be taught?

- this was a lively debate because these young ambitious men who aspired to virtue thought they could learn it through Sophists, like Protagorus or Gorgias (Meno was a student of Gorgias)

Not all of these Sophists would claim they taught virtue, but some taught how to speak well.

Protagorus says it is how one reaches their maximum potential for success in political debate:

**Protagorus**: "What I teach is sound deliberation, both in domestic matters, how best to manage one's household, and in public affairs, how to realize one's maximum potential for success in political debate and action" (Protagoras, 319a)

On the one hand, the wisdom of Pericles, on the other hand, the persuasive skill taught by the Sophists, we can understand some of the popular distrust of the Sophists.

We as the electorate want to elect those that are knowledgeable of how to run the state.

But these Sophists seem to teach how to get elected, how to seem to have the expertise of Pericles.

We don't want to elect someone just because they are good at convincing us to vote for them.

Remember, **Anytus** (a political conservative of the day who does not like the Sophists) was one of Socrates' accusers in *Plato's Apology*

Anytus is Meno's host in Athens.

Anytus protests in the strongest terms when Socrates asked him if Sophists teach virtue.

**Anytus**: "...They plainly pervert and corrupt those who are associated with them." (91c)

Anytus thinks instead of paying foreigners to teach you aret&#275;, it should be taught to you the old fashioned way, by associating with those who already have it.

- these are the successful and reputable politicians of the city, among which he numbers himself.
- apprenticeship model
- virtue is like a skill being taught from one generation to the next
- Themistocles and Pericles would have taught virtue

How is it that the sons of Pericles and the sons of Themistocles did not themselves learn the virtue that their father's possessed? Why did they not distinguish themselves like their fathers?

How did this happen if virtue is something teachable, Socrates asks.

He says they surely taught their sons other great and valuable skills, but failed to teach virtue to them.

Then he concludes that **all knowledge is recollection.**

## Part 2, Lecture 19: Theory of Recollection

What is virtue?

Much like in Euthyphro when asked, "What is piety?"

Socrates asks Meno to demonstrate virtue:

**Socrates**: "Even if the virtues are many and multifarious, surely they all have one identical form, because of which they are all virtues...?" (Meno 72c)

Meno cannot define virtue.

Socrates *elenchos*: cross-examination

Then, Socrates suggests they inquire together.

**Meno**: "And how are you going to inquire about it, Socrates, when you do not know what it is?" (80d)

**Socrates**: "Since the soul is immortal, then, and has been born many times, and has seen both the things here and the ones in Hades--in fact, all tings--there is nothing it has not learned. So it is in no way surprising that it can recollect about virtue and other things, since it knew them before..." (81c)

Socrates calls in the boy to see if he is recollecting what he knows or not.

**Socrates insists he is only asking questions, not teaching.**

## Part 2, Lecture 20: Was Socrates Teaching?

Teaching vs. Inquiry

Socrates' definitions:

Inquiry: figure it out for yourselves

Teaching: somebody else gives you the correct answer

The slave hasn't been the one to figure out which questions to ask, which is crucial for solving the problem.

If Socrates were not there, not likely the slave would figure it out.

**The bigger point Socrates is trying to make one can ask questions without already knowing the answer and still discover the right answer.**

- eventually, maybe one asks the right questions to solve the problem

**Socrates is saying we all have it in us to answer the step by step questions correctly when we consider the matter carefully.**

Normative questions to philosophers: questions about good and bad, right and wrong.

Socrates' proposal is that questions about virtue and goodness and indeed all philosophical questions are like mathematics and geometry in one crucial respect. A respect that Heraclitus captured in his declaration:

**Heraclitus**: "I searched into myself" (Heraclitus B101)

According to Socrates, we proceed by **examining what we believe about piety, about virtue, about knowledge**, not by empirical inquiry or a scientific inquiry.

**Plato thinks that questions about value, and indeed all philosophical questions, are as objective as mathematics and geometry.**

He proposes a theory that explains our success in the mathematical case, and predicts the possibility of success int he ethical and the philosophical case.

In our study of Plato, we will see more of the theory of goodness that he develops, including its relation to mathematics and geometry.

## Part 2, Lecture 21: Meno's Paradox

Socrates says since he does not know what virtue is, he does not know the answer to Meno's question, "What is virtue?" or "How to be virtuous?"

He gives an example:

**Socrates**: "Do you think it is possible for someone, who does not know at all who Meno is, to know whether Meno is beautiful or rich or of noble birth, or the opposites of these?" (Meno 71b)

**The Priority of Definition**: If I don't know what X is, then I don't know anything about X.

Then, Meno is exasperated at Socrates because he says, "How are we to discover virtue if we don't know anything about it."

**The Paradox of Inquiry**:

1. If I don't know what X is, I don't know anything about X.
2. If I don't know anything about X, then I can't inquire successfully into what X is.
3. So, If I don't know what X is, I can't inquire successfully into what X is.

Socrates uses recollection to show this conclusion to be false.

- one can come to the right answer without knowing anything about it.

Socrates makes a distinction between **knowledge** and **true belief**.

- the slave had true beliefs, but not knowledge to eventually arrive at the correct answer

We may not have knowledge, but we can use our true beliefs to come to the correct answer.

## Part 2, Lecture 22: Knowledge vs. True Belief

Epistemology: theory of knowledge

Socrates says the great men who ran the city well had true beliefs, that were divinely given to them.

Socrates differences between the two:

- the method upon how they were attained
- True belief is like a wandering animal, knowledge is tied down

- what ties down knowledge from a true belief is by reasoning out the explanation.

Once the slave has mastered the geometric proof, will understand why it is true.

We can have true beliefs about virtue to help us find the correct answer to, "What is virtue?"

Plato's Republic will have us delve into answering these questions.

## Part 1, Lecture 23: Is Justice a Virtue?

The dialogue of whether justice is a virtue lasts for 10 books.

Justice is like our questions of right and wrong.

They are unable to come up with an answer.

Different definitions of justice:

**Cephalus**: speaking the truth and paying one's debts... (Republic 331c)

**Simonides**: giving to each what is owed to him (331e)

**Polemarchus**: helping friends and harming enemies (332d)

Socrates has a true belief that justice is a virtue.

Thrasymachus is keen on virtue, but he doesn't think that justice is a virtue.

- How could it be, he complains, if the benefits of my acting justly go to other people not to myself.
- The general idea behind his complaint is this: **justice requires that you curb your pursuit of wealth, power, and the like, that you respect the boundaries and claims of other people.**
- That's clearly good for the other people, but how could it be good for you?

**Thrasymachus**: Injustice, if it is on a large enough scale, is stronger, freer, and more masterful than justice...profitable and advantageous for oneself (344c)

Thrasymachus' slogan: **justice is the good of another (allotrion agathon)**

- justice may be a quality we admire in another, but we shouldn't aspire to ourselves.
- so it doesn't count as a virtue in the sense of virtue that we have been working with

**Fundamental dispute between Socrates and Thrasymachus is over whether justice is a virtue.**

- this is important because it concerns the most important issue we could address: **what sort of life should we live?**
  - this is the sort of question that he urges on his contemporaries in the sorts of conversations that he reports in the Apology

Socrates gets Thrasymachus to agree that the just person is good and wise, and lives a blessed a happy life, but Thrasymachus is not satisfied.

- very different than the slave boy from before

He has been defeated, charmed like a snake, as Glaucon put it.

Glaucon and Adeimantus are also not satisfied.

Whether justice is a virtue is very much still an open question to them.

They were raised to praise justice and condemn injustice, but don't know why they believe this.

And under the pressure of questioning from skeptics like Thrasymachus, they're vulnerable to having their true beliefs wander away.

**The usual arguments for being just**:

- Rewards from a just reputation
- Punishments for injustice, if you get caught
- Rewards and punishments in the afterlife

**But these consequences are not inevitable they point out.**

- ritual expiation will appease the gods and a truly consummate practitioner of injustice will be able to cover up his transgressions and secure a reputation for justice
- That way, one can reap all the benefits of a just reputation while still committing and profiting from injustice.
- If you could do that, why stick to justice?

Socrates uses Books 2, 3, and 4 of the Republic that justice is always preferable to injustice, even if it goes unnoticed and unrewarded by the gods and by one's fellow citizens.

## Part 1, Lecture 24: The Just City

What is justice?

Socrates states two forms: political justice and injustice, and just and unjust people.

Socrates says it will be easier to prove his thesis by starting with the political case: justice in a city.

What is justice in a city? In a polis? That is, a self-governing political community.

He starts with what a city is for.

He proposes:

- easier to satisfy our basic needs and desires, for food, clothing, and shelter, and even to satisfy more extravagant desires for luxuries, art and entertainment

We do much better if we live with one another and divide up the work.

This is incomplete Socrates tells us.

- we also need resources: land, water, minerals and so forth
- we also have to defend our resources so we need a military to defend them
- but we also need someone to give orders to the military to ensure they act in the interests of the other citizens, instead of using their coercive power to exploit or enslave them.

The rulers, he says, will need to be knowledgeable about what is good for the city.

This yields three basic sorts of jobs or functions in a state:

- Rulers (guardians)
- Auxiliaries (military)
- Producers (money makers)

In a well-functioning state, not just any state, it is important that the people who occupy these different political roles be well suited to the task.

Those suited by training and temperament to be soldiers shouldn't be ruling the state, that's a military dictatorship.

Those suited to be moneymakers shouldn't be given the coercive power of the military, or even worse, the office of ruler. They should leave the ruling to others.

**When each person in a city plays the political role that is due to them given their natural qualifications, that's what justice is in a city, according to Socrates.**

**Justice is doing one's own work, and not meddling with what is not your own.** (433a-b)

All this talk of people who are naturally fit or unfit to hold political office is likely to be very objectionable to those of us with democratic principles.

But we can set aside that sort of objection for now if we turn from the case of the city to the analogous case of the individual person. Where the claim, I think, is much less objectionable.

In the picture that Socrates will draw of the human psyche, or soul, **it is really important that the right element be in charge.**

## Part 1, Lecture 25: The Just Soul

Socrates proposes than an individual person has the same kind of internal complexity as the city that he has just described.

That is, a person has a part that is fit to rule, a part that is fit to be its helper or ally, and a part that can't be trusted with any authority and is only fit to be ruled.

More specifically, he says that **it is the person's soul that has these three parts.**

- Soul translates the Greek word *psuche*, from which our term psychology derives.

The tripartite psychology of the Republic:

| Parts of a Soul | Parts of a City          |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Reason          | Rulers (guardians)       |
| Spirit          | Auxiliaries (military)   |
| Appetite        | Producers (money makers) |

- They each check and balance one another.
- not an accident that Freud's **Id, Superego**, and **Ego** as Freud read Plato

We become vividly aware of the complexity within us when our different soul parts conflict, as in the examples I've just given.

- pretty much the same ones Socrates invokes to argue that we are tripartite, just like the city.

But experiencing such conflict is not inevitable or desirable.

*Wouldn't it be better not to struggle in the first place?* Socrates agrees.

- he likens conflicts between the parts of one soul to civil war, stasis within the soul, a terrible and unfortunately pervasive problem in the city-states in Plato's day.

Now, properly functioning souls will be ones in which there is no civil war. Reason will rule without a struggle. And appetites and emotions will be in line with reason's judgements about what is best. 

- not to say that a properly functioning soul will never experience strong emotion
- **They will do so when reason judges that it is appropriate, but will never experience conflict or any subsequent regrets.**
- In such a harmonious internal condition of a soul, each part will be doing what it is good at.
  - Reason will be ruling.
  - The spirited, emotional, part will be supporting and enforcing reason's judgments.
  - The appetites will be pursuing various projects and enjoyments that make up our daily lives.

A soul full of conflict, regularly defeating its own purposes, is when either the spirited or appetitive portion of the soul tries to usurp reason.

- **this is the unjust person's soul according to Socrates**
- Socrates also says no one wants to live like that

**The contrasting high functioning and harmonious psychology is justice.**

- it so defined is an intrinsically desirable condition of the psyche

Glaucon compares the unjust soul to a ruined body at the end of book 4.

**Justice, as Socrates is defining it, is a necessary condition for any of those other things (wealth, power, fame, etc.) being good.**

With a ruined soul, life is not worth living and no amount of wealth and power can make it so.

In summation:

1. JUSTICE: reason rules, spirit acts as its ally, and the appetites are governed by both. (443c-e)
2. INJUSTICE: insurrection, strife in the soul. (444b)
3. So, an unjust soul is a ruined soul. (445b)
4. Life isn't worth living with a ruined soul, no matter how much wealth, power, etc. one has (445a-b)
5. So, justice is always preferable to injustice.

## Part 1, Lecture 26: Rationality

Why should we agree that our souls are in this condition if we break the law, or if we take more than our fair share?

Think about organized crime or philosopher Hannah Arendt called the banality of evil, a phrase she coined to describe the dispassionate bureaucratic demeanor of Adolf Eichmann, mastermind of genocide at his war crimes trial in 1961.

Isn't reason in control?

This is the sort of person Glaucon describes as the consummate practitioner of injustice in Book II.

**Principle of charity** in philosophy: when you criticize or take issue with the arguments of another philosopher, you need to consider the strongest possible case for the view you are criticizing or disagreeing with.

Plato's Socrates thinks that goodness is an objective matter.

- **it is reason's job to figure out what is actually good, not just to maximize desire satisfaction.**
  - think of it as the CEO of the soul
    - if it abdicates this job, with appetite as the CEO, then Socrates' position is we might as well be raving and out of control

The closer look at the objective notion of goodness that it presupposes is in books five, six, and seven.
