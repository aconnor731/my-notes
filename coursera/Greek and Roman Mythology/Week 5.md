## Week 5

### 5.1: Introducing the Greek Gods

- the Gods were indeed born
- the time period we will be concerned with will be before the world is born

### 5.2: Hesiod and Ancient Near East Connections

- Sumerians and Babylonians were around millenia before the Greeks
- many peoples occupied the "fertile crescent"
- Epic of Gilgamesh, Sumerian Epic, the oldest Epic known to man
- generations overflow older ones is a common themes throughout these cultures' stories
- Homer is more isolated versus the interconnectedness of Hesiod

### 5.3: Intro to Hesiod

- with Hesiod, we are carrying forward with Greek epic poetry.
- both use this special diction of dactylic hexameter meter
- begin the thought that the Greeks are one collective identity
  - Homer and Hesiod are very important to this
- Homer emphasizes the Heroes, Hesiod emphasizes the gods
- Hesiod does not focus on a narrative, unlike Homer, the master storyteller
- lists are very prominent in Hesiod
- alphabet was arriving during Hesiod's time
- Hesiod connects
- sense of grandeur in epics, totality
  - everything that is important to remember will be in the epic poem
  - the most full cultural repository one can find
- geneology is important
  - main structuring device for how poetry is supposed to work
  - not just of humans, but of the universe
  - order from chaos using geneology
- Hesiod's story does not have a single narrative much like how a family tree does not have a single narrative
- different versions of Aphrodite's birth between Homer and Hesiod
- differences in the births of the gods between Hesiod and Homer
- Hesiod makes sure it all fits in
- Hesiod wants to unveil the deep secrets of the past whereas Homer wants to explain the great deeds of the past
- there isn't one, single true version of these myths
- Hesiod is well-fed in antiquity and is authoritative
- collection of disparate tales and occasionally, one comes along and marks a large stamp (as we will see with Ovid)

### 5.4 Hesiod's Opening Hymn to the Muses

- lived in central Greece
- father came from modern-day Turkey
  - we think he made a living at farming
- Hesiod says he became a poet from the Muses that came down from Mt. Helicon
- Hesiod has sort of an almanac theme in his "Works and Days"
- Hesiod doesn't just jump into the middle of the story like Homer does, he starts by praising the Muses for 100 lines before saying goodbye to them (which is normal for Greek hymns)
- Hesiod's opening fits the form of Homeric hymns
- Homer has a single Muse, and he becomes a conduit for that Muse
- Gives a fascinating meditation on the greatness of poetry
- Can see backwards, present, and forward, like a prophet
- Poets see things that normal people cannot and pass them on to immortalize them
- Inspires what makes a great King, Hesiod elevates the importance of Poets on the same level of kings, a poet-king
- a large purview makes a great ruler
- we learn from the poets that Muses sing truths and sing lies
- Hesiod has laid the setting for the Muses and for what is to come

### 5.5: Earth and Sky

- how might they all fit together? This is the question Hesiod worked to answer
- Hesiod's world reproduction comes through sex
- In Hesiod's world, there is a pre-beginning consisting of 4 beings:
  - **Chasm**
    - Greek name: "Chaos"
    - means "emptiness"
    - best English translation is "Chasm"
  - **Earth**
  - **Tartara**
    - an underworld, down below the regular upper world that we might know
    - it is a scary place
  - **Eros**
    - abstract sexual desire
    - not gentle love, but violent and sometimes dangerous
    - cause destruction
- They are just there, they existed since the beginning
- **Chasm** alone produces, **Erebos** and **dark Night**
- Night alone produces **Bright Air** and **Day** whom she bore in shared intimacy with **Erebos**
- The "alpha" stage (taken from software)
  - **Earth** produces **Sky** out of herself
  - **Sky** then becomes her partner
  - From them, **Titans** are born
  - Famous monsters are created, like **Cyclops** and **One-hundred hands**
- **Sky** and **Earth** are intimate with each other
- **Earth** doesn't want **Sky** to be on top of her every night because he is stopping everything that she creates from coming out
- **Sky** is also threatened by her offspring. He is trying to control it.
- **Earth** gets her children to cut off **Sky's** genitals (**Kronos** does it)
- **Kronos** hurls the genitals into the sea
- This is deeply effective at disempowering the **Sky**
- A bunch of principles/children come out of her every night
- The genitals drop blood into the ocean
  - they create the Eunauaes
  - they are blood avengers
- **Aphrodite** grows out of the foam, "aphros", from the genitals in the ocean
  - not a gentle birth
- **Parthenogenesis**: creation by oneself only
- nasty creatures come from this stage of creation
- also a long list of nymphs are created
  - not associated with any negativity or violence
### 5.6: Kronos and Rhea

- they start generation stage "Beta"
- **Kronos** and **Rhea** are brother and sister and lovers
- they reproduce all kinds of things, Olympian divinities, but not all of them come from **Kronos** and **Rhea**, **Zeus** gives birth to some Olympian divinities himself
- the violence he committed against his father, **Sky**, came onto **Kronos**
- **Kronos** eats his own children that **Rhea** bore
  - since they are immortals, they are not digested, they are trapped in his stomach
  - his terrible reputation is that he ate his own children
- He learned from **Earth** and **Starry Heaven** that one of his own children will overthrow him
- **Rhea** hands **Kronos** a stone instead of **Zeus**, and since he is rather dumb, he does not catch it
- Meanwhile, **Zeus** is placed on Crete where he develops himself to overthrow **Kronos**
- Earth gets **Kronos** to vomit up his children and the stone lands in Delphi and is called **omphalos** or in Greek, "naval"

### 5.7: Humans and Sacrifice

- humans are just there
- for Hesiod, it is not a big deal that humans arrive on the scene
- humans keep the world functioning by serving the gods through sacrifice
- story of human beings comes through **Prometheus** at Mekone
- **Prometheus** tries to deceive **Zeus** by giving him a bad sacrifice and the humans keep the good sacrifice
  - **Zeus** wasn't really duped, but now, humans give the bones to the gods, but they feel guilty about this
  - logic is a little hard to understand
- **Zeus** is angry and punishes **Prometheus** and takes the fire back from the humans, but **Prometheus** sneeks back and steals the fire to give to the humans.
- As punishment, **Prometheus** has an eagle eat out his liver, upon which it grows back
- female humans are brought to punish men
  - misogynistic
- **Heracles** saves **Prometheus** from his punishment

### 5.8: War, Cosmos, Reproduction

- **Zeus** and **Kronos** go at each other for 10 years for the stakes of the universe
- Earth tricks **Kronos** to vomit up his children with **Zeus** involved
- The **Cyclops** give **Zeus** the thunderbolt (the nuclear weapon of the day) to defeat **Kronos**
- **Zeus** persuade the **Cyclops** by freeing them from under the Earth that were placed there by the **Titans**
- **Zeus** crushes the **Titans** using the thunderbolt and chains them in **Tartaros**, the very farthest place of the cosmos, a nasty place
- **Zeus** makes a lot of alliances that were also mistreated by the **Titans**:
- **Zeus** cannot kill the immortal **Titans**, but he can bind them
- the Earth is shaking so much that even the **Chasm** is shaking
  - this war shakes the universe down to its fundamental pieces
- younger generations overthrow older generations, but with **Zeus**, it is final
- **Zeus** has earned his place through struggle
- **Zeus** defeating the **Titans** is in parallel with the cosmos gaining **order**
- the river **Styx** runs through **Tartaros**, which even the gods can take an oath on
- through **Zeus**' conquering of the **Titans**, the ability to reproduce is developed
- reproduction initially begins with **Gaia**
  - then **Themis**, but not nearly as much
  - then **Theia**
  - then **Rhea**, who gives birth to **Zeus**
  - all give roughly under a dozen
- then **Zeus** reproduces a ton by getting the power of reproduction
- **Zeus** has relations with the goddess **Metis** and then swallows her
- **Zeus** gives birth to **Athena** by assimillating the power of reproduction while **Metis** is in his stomach
  - he can now give birth on his own
- Earth has a pivotal role, the most productive role in the universe, sometimes on the side of **Zeus** and sometimes not
  - she also disempowers the **Sky** and hands over power of the universe to her son **Zeus**
  - she schemes with **Rhea** to have **Kronos** swallow a stone and places **Zeus** in a cave on Crete
  - she advises all the Olympians to agree to serve **Zeus**
  - she also advises **Zeus** to swallow **Metis**
- order and structure is based on **Zeus**, the powerful male principle

### 5.9: Freud

- return to the toolbox

- already talked about **structuralism** and **functionalism**

- after Hesiod, it is great to introduce **Sigmund Freud**

  - pivotal role in the humanities and human sciences
  - important set of observations summary:
    - **myths dramatize events in every individuals' mental or psychological development**
    - as a doctor, Freud is interested in any of us as a patient, as a member of the human species
    - our psyche is something every human has and develops
    - earlier view of the psyche before id, ego, and superego
    - in his interpretations of dreams:
      - Conscious
      - repression barrier
        - in healthy people it keeps the unconscious at bay
        - if it weren't, we would answer to them and they could be toxic and antisocial
      - Unconscious
    - if there were no repression barrier, we would try and find the deepest pleasures we could find
    - Freud also says that we receive pleasure from dominating others
    - Conscious desires are the tip of the iceberg and the unconscious is the rest of it
    - Freud says we have urges to have sex with anyone, even with those that are forbidden
      - this amps up the desire even more
      - Freud says we have urges to have sex with a parent and that we want to remove the same sex parent
    - Freud says these are present in all of us but they are kept down by the repression barrier
    - Freud says sometimes the repression barrier allows some unconscious desires to be pursued after being changed through condensation or displacement
      - like a tea kettle that lets off some steam by turning the forbidden urges into symbols, this is what Freud called **displacement**
    - myths are the dreams of an entire culture
    - the desire to overcome the father, we can vicariously live through the story of **Zeus** overthrowing **Kronos**
    - **Freud says we all have the desires through this apparatus**
      - just not all the time
      - always engaged in myth making through our dreams
    - Freud gives us a great tool when we encounter the question, "Why in the world would a culture want to tell itself a myth like this?"
