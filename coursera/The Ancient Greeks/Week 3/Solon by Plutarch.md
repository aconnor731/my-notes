# Solon by Plutarch

"Wealth I would have, but wealth by wrong procue I would not; justice, e'en if slow, is sure."

"Some wicked men are rich, some good are poor,
We will not change our virtue for their store:
Virtue's a thing that none can take away;
But money changes owners all the day."

Anacharsis, being once at the Assembly, expressed his wonder at the fact that in Greece wise men spoke and fools decided.

For the soul, having a principle of kindness in itself, and being born to love, as well as perceive, think, or remember, inclines and fixes upon some stranger, when a man has none of his own to embrace.

It is not affection, it is weakness that brings men, unarmed against fortune by reason; and they indeed have not even the present enjoyment of what they dote upon, the possibility of the future loss causing them continual pangs, tremors, and distresses.

After the Cylonian sedition, the disparity between the rich and the poor was very large. **All the people were indebted to the rich**; and either they tilled their land for their creditors, paying them a sixth part of the increase, and were, therefore, called Hectemorii and Thetes, or else they engaged their body for the debt, and might be seized, and either sent into slavery at home, or sold to strangers; some (for no law forbade it) were forced to sell their children, or fly their country to avoid the cruelty of their creditors; **but the most part and the bravest of them began to combine together and encourage one another to stand to it, to choose a leader, to liberate the condemned debtors, divide the land, and change the government.**

Solon was chosen as archon because he was wealthy to the rich and honest to the poor.

There was a saying of his current before the election, that **when things are even there never can be war, and this pleased both parties, the wealthy and the poor**.

"Solon surely was a dreamer, and a man of simple mind;
When the gods would give him fortune, he of his own will declined.

When the net was full of fishes, over-heavy thinking  it, 
He declined to haul it up, through want of heart and want of  wit. 
Had but I that chance of riches and of kingship, for one  day, 
I would give my skin for flaying, and my house to die  away."

Solon called cancelling debts **Seisacthea**, a relief, or disencumbrance.

Everyone did not like him after he cancelled debts and did not redistribute the lands, angering both the rich and the poor.

"Such power I gave the people as might do,
Abridged not what they had, now lavished new,
Those that were great in wealth and high in place
My counsel likewise kept from all disgrace.
Before them both I held my shield of might,
And let not either touch the other's right."

Since the country has but few rivers, lakes, or large springs, and many used wells which they had dug, there was a law made, that, where there was a public well within a hippicon, that is, four furlongs, all should draw at that; but when it was farther off, they should try and procure a well of their own; and if they had dug ten fathoms deep and could find no water, they had liberty to fetch a pitcherful of four gallons and a half in a day from their neighbours'; for he thought it prudent to make provision against want, but not to supply laziness.

The law concerning naturalizing strangers is of doubtful character; he permitted only those to be made free of Athens who were in perpetual exile from their own country, or came with their whole family to trade there; this he did, not to discourage strangers, but rather to invite them to a permanent participation in the privileges of the government; and, besides, he thought those would prove the more faithful citizens who had been forced from their own country, or voluntarily forsook it.

Solon left Athens for ten years because he was damned if he did and damned if he didn't explain his laws to the people.

After Pisistratus seized the Acropolis after the people did not stand up against this tyranny, Solon appealed to them to destroy the tyranny before them as their inadvertent and meanness of spirit allowed it to endure. He then wrote this after laying his arms in front of his house:

"If now you suffer, do not blame the Powers,
For they are good, and all the fault was ours,
All the strongholds you put into his hands,
And now his slaves must do what he commands."



"Each day grow older, and learn something new;" and again-

"But now the Powers, of Beauty, Song, and Wine,
Which are most men's delights, are also mine."
