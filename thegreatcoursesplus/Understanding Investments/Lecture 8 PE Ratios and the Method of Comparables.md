# Lecture 8: P/E Ratios and the Method of Comparables

**Valuation models**:

- how to drill down into a company and its stock using valuation models
- **extremely important to stock picking**
- helps us determine how much something is worth

There is no absolute truth to the value of an investment.

Disagreements arise from several good reasons:

1. The value of any investment relies upon what will happen in the future
2. You have to make a ton of judgment calls to the application of valuation models to the real world

**Method of Comparables**: Price-to-earnings ratio: P/E ratio

- Stock picking model
- This model is widely used in many financial markets outside of just the stock market.
- Professionals prefer to use this by far because it is simple, fast, and reliable
- It speaks directly to what an asset should be worth

- Starts with a simple idea:
  - **Earnings** is one of **Value drivers**
    - Location is a value driver in real estate
- Second idea, use a ratio of the price and the value driver of an asset
  - $ \frac{P_A}{V_A} = \frac{P_B}{V_B} $
  - For Instance, if Asset A and B are comparable:
    - $ V_A $ = Earnings per share, Company A
    - $ \frac{P_A}{V_A} $ = Earnings multiple
    - $ \Big( \frac{P_A}{V_A} \Big) \times Company\ B's\ earnings = Company\ B's\ price\ (estimate) $
- **Three most popular value drivers**:
  - **EPS** (Earnings per share)
  - **Book value per share**: balance sheet equity/shares
  - Sales per share
- So three most popular ratios used:
  - Price/Earnings ratio
  - Price/Book ratio
  - Price/Sales ratio

Finding comparable assets to your particular company typically involves finding similar stocks in the same industry.

Example: Cracker Barrel

We need to investigate why it is considered overvalued according to Book value and EPS and undervalued according Sales.

We must dive deeper into the ratios.

Analysts track the P/E ratio by considering the stock's growth rate alongside it.

They created another ratio to do that:

- **PEG ratio**: (P/E ratio)/Growth rate of earnings = (P/E)/G

  - P/E ratio divided by Growth (G)

  - For Cheesecake Factory:

    (26.14/1.67) = 15.65

    15.65/14.34 = 1.09

    - | Price relationship  | PEG ratio |
      | ------------------- | --------- |
      | Underpriced stock   | <1        |
      | Fairly valued stock | 1         |
      | Overpriced stock    | \>1       |

Current P/E ratio of S&P 500 is ~28 and is typically around ~14.

- dot com bubble of 2000 was around ~26
