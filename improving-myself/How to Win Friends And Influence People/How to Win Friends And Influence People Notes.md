# How to Win Friends And Influence People Notes



## 7: How to Get Cooperation

Don't you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself than in ideas that are handed to you on a silver platter? If so, isn't it bad judgment to try to ram your opinions down the throats of other people? Isn't it wiser to make suggestions-and let the other person think out the conclusion.

No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.

Letting the other person feel that the idea is his or hers not only works in business and politics, it works in family life as well.

Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay "Self-Reliance" stated: "In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to use with a certain alienated majesty."

The others had been trying to sell me on their service, but one let me sell myself. That organization won.

**Lao-tse, the Chinese sage said, "The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury."**

**<u>Principle 7</u>: Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.**

## 8: A Formula That Will Work Wonders for You

Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people try to understand people when they are totally wrong and they do not think they are wrong.

If you say to yourself, "How would I feel, how would I react if I were in his shoes?" you will save yourself time and irritation, for "**by becoming interested in the cause, we are less likely to dislike the effect.**"

Along with Lincoln and Roosevelt, you will have grasped the only solid foundation for interpersonal relationships; **success in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the other person's viewpoint.**

In his book *Getting Through to People*, Dr. Gerald S. Nirenberg commented: "Cooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person's ideas and feelings as important as your own. Starting your conversation by giving the other person the purpose or direction of your conversation, governing what you say by what you would want to hear if you were the listener, and accepting his or her viewpoint will encourage the listener to have an open mind to your ideas."

**_I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person's office for two hours before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person--from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives--was likely to answer._**

**<u>Principle 8:</u> Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.**

## 9: What Everybody Wants

Magic phrase to stop arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good will, and make the other person listen attentively: **"I don't blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do."**

Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.

Because he had apologized and sympathized with her point of view, she began apologizing and sympathizing with my point of view.

Dr. Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book *Educational Psychology*: "Sympathy the human species universally craves. The child eagerly displays his injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults...show their bruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details of surgical operations. 'Self-pity' for misfortunes real or imaginary is, in some measure, practically a universal practice."

So if you want to win people to your way of thinking, put in practice...

**<u>Principle 9</u>: Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.**

## 10: An Appeal That Everybody Likes

The fact is that all people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation, even people like Jesse James.

J.P. Morgan observed that a person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.

The person himself will think of the real reason. You don't need to emphasize that. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good.

So, in order to change people, **appeal to the nobler motives.**

**<u>Principle 10</u>: Appeal to the nobler motives.**

## 11: The Movies Do It. TV Does It. Why Don't You Do It?

Merely stating a truth isn't enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you want attention.

You can dramatize your ideas in business or in any other aspect of your life.

**<u>Principle 11</u>: Dramatize your ideas.**

## 12: When Nothing Else Works, Try This

Let Charles Schwab say the principle in his own words: "The way to get things done," says Schwab, "is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, **but in the desire to excel.**"

"All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory" - motto of the King's Guard in ancient Greece

What greater challenge can be offered than the opportunity to overcome those fears?

This is what every successful person loves: the game. The chance for self-expression. The chance to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win.

**<u>Principle 12</u>: Throw down a challenge.**



## Part 4 - Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment

## 1: If You Must Find Fault, This Is the Way to Begin

**It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.**

A barber lathers a man before he shaves him.

Beginning with praise is like the dentist who begins his work with Novocain. The patient still gets a drilling, but the Novocain is pain-killing. A leader will use...

**<u>Principle 1</u>: Begin with praise and honest appreciation.**

## 2: How to Criticize--and Not Be Hated for It

Change the word "but" to "and" when giving criticism, mixing in praise to the critique.

Call attention to one's indirectly.

An effective way to correct others' mistakes is...

**<u>Principle 2</u>: Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.**

## 3: Talk About Your Own Mistakes First

Begin your criticism by talking about your own shortcomings and the other person's superiority--not by intimating that the person was a half-wit in need of a guardian.

A good leader follows this principle:

**<u>Principle 3</u>: Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.**

## 4: No One Likes to Take Orders

Give suggestions, not orders.

Say "You might consider this," or "Do you think that would work?" instead of "Do this or do that" or "Don't do this or don't do that."

A technique like that saves a person's pride and gives him or her a feeling of importance. It encourages cooperation instead of rebellion.

Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask.

People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.

An effective leader will use...

**<u>Principle 4</u>: Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.**

## 5: Let the Other Person Save Face

"Firing employees is not much fun. Getting fired is even less fun."

Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face.

"I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime." - Legendary French aviation pioneer and author Antoine de Saint-Exupery

A real leader will always follow...

**<u>Principle 5</u>: Let the other person save face.**

## 6: How to Spurt People On to Success

Let us praise even the slightest improvement. That inspires the other person to keep on improving.

"Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit; we cannot flower and grow without it. And yet, while most of us are only too ready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we are somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine of praise." - Psychologist Jess Lair in his book *I Ain't Much, Baby--But I'm All I Got*

Use of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept of B. F. Skinner's teachings.

He showed by experiments with animals and with humans that when criticism is minimized and praise emphasized, the good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.

Do not just flatter someone by saying, "You're good." Specifically point out how their work is superior.

Everybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere--not something the other person may be saying just to make one feel good.

Nobody wants insincerity. Nobody wants flattery.

I you and I will inspire the people with whom we come in contact to a realization of the hidden treasures they possess, we can do far more than change people. We can literally transform them.

Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.

To become a more effective leader of people, apply...

**<u>Principle 6</u>: Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise."**

## 7: Give a Dog a Good Name

"The average person," said Samuel Vauclain, then president of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, "can be led readily if you have his or her respect and if you show that you respect that person for some kind of ability."

If you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as thought that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.

Shakespeare said, "Assume a virtue, if you have it not."

There is an old saying: "Give a dog a bad name and you may as well hang him." But give him a good name--and see what happens!

If you want to excel in that difficult leadership role of changing the attitude or behavior of others, use...

**<u>Principle 7</u>: Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.**

## 8: Make the Fault Seem Easy to Correct

Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed almost every incentive to try to improve.

But use the opposite technique--be liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it--and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.

If you want to help others to improve, remember...

**<u>Principle 8</u>: Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.**

## 9: Making People Glad to Do What You Want

One of the important rules of human relations: *Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.*

The technique of giving titles and authority worked for Napoleon and it will work for you.

The effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change attitudes or behavior:

1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.
2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.
3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what it is the other person really wants.
4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.
5. Match those benefits to the other person's wants.
6. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.

People are more likely to do what you would like them to do when you use...

**<u>Principle 9</u>: Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.**
