# Lecture 2: How Investors Make Money

Can anyone beat the market?

If someone can, how do you do it?

**Efficient Markets Hypothesis**

- origin 1950's and 1960's
- Economist Eugene Fama is accredited with it
- intense competition among investors makes markets efficient
- **Material information**: very valuable information that affects the asset



**2 consequences to the EMH:**

1. **Any material information about an asset that is known now is already incorporated into current market prices**
2. **New information is incorporated into asset prices extremely quickly, if not instantly**



**Market prices reflect all current information.**

3 different versions of EMH:

1. Weak efficient markets hypothesis: current asset prices incorporate past and current information, but nothing else
2. semi-strong EMH: all publicly available information
3. Strong EMH: incorporate all information, both private and public information

What is private information?

- only known to a few people, very rarely shared



According to the EMH, we can't beat the market.

Peter Lynch's strategy: GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price)
