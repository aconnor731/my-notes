# Lecture 4: How to Practice the Guitar

"Don not overload the foundation,
do not carry the building
higher than the base permits,
or build at all before the base is secure:
otherwise the whole structure is likely to collapse."

"Genius is long patience." - A.G. Sertillanges

**Keep your movement to a minimum.**

**Tip to Practice**:

- Don't pin elbow against your body
- Visualize your left hand moving along the straight line of the neck

**The guitar is a Transposing Instrument**: It sounds an octave below where the note is written on the page.
