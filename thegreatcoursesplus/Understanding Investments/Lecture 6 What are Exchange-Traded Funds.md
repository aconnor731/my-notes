# Lecture 6: What are Exchange-Traded Funds?

Ways to invest:

- Stocks
- Bonds
- Mutual Funds
- Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF)

**GLD**: gold ETF

- don't have to worry about storage of gold bars
- 1 gold bullion is 400 oz

ETFs are quite different from mutual funds

First was introduced in 1993.

\$1 trillion in assets in ETFs as of 2010.

They are the second largest pooled investment behind open-ended mutual funds.

ETFs combine features from stocks and mutual funds:

- like stocks in that they are listed on an exchange

**Depository receipt**:

- **convert foreign assets into convenient investments**
- been around for a long time
- most commonly used before ETFs in trading shares of foreign stocks
- stored in a specialized depository bank so that they can be sold to other investors
- are traded in the U.S. and are priced in U.S. dollars
  - Depository receipts make it easy to trade foreign assets outside their foreign country
- can divide up the value of the deposited asset however they choose

**Standard & Poor's Depository Receipts (SPDR or SPY)** used Depository receipts for the S&P 500.

**World Equity Benchmark Shares **(WEBS)

First came the SPDRs then came the WEBs

**Securities Exchange Act of 1933**

**Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)**: are regulated to try to protect individual investors

ETFs can be traded anytime the market is open (as opposed to mutual funds exclusively at the end of the trading day: 4pm)

**Taxes**:

- ETFs give you much more flexibility with incurring capital gains tax

  - short-term capital gains (<1 year) is treated as income according to your marginal tax bracket

  - long-term capital gains (>1 year) is much lower than the income tax rate
  - can choose more flexibly whether you want a short or long term capital gains tax

- open-end mutual funds are much more inflexible: **you almost certainly owe capital gains tax**

  - they pass all of the dividend income and capital gains onto the investors
  - 

**Turnover rate**: fraction of the mutual fund the asset manager trades

- **look for low turnover rates (right after the fees table in the prospectus)**

**ETFs are tax efficient**, people say.

IRAs and 401(k)s only pay tax upon withdraw funds.

ETFs advantages over mutual funds:

- lower expenses and higher returns than identical mutual funds would

**You cash out your ETF shares buy selling them to another investor at market price (unlike mutual funds where you have to redeem your shares that are accompanied by a fee).**

You have to pay similar trading fees as trading stocks with ETFs.

**Arbitrage**: when the underlying asset and its ETF (depository receipt) have their prices converge towards one another.

- for example, a very strong arbitrage between the S&P 500 index and the S&P 500 index futures contract
- generally works well, but occasionally (like the crash of 1987 due to computer problems) it fails

Another disadvantage for ETFs: **Leverage**
