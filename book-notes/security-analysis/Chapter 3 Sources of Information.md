# Chapter 3: Sources of Information

## Data on the Terms of the Issue

The typical case the analyst seeks data regards:

1. the terms of the specific issue
2. the company
3. the industry

## Data on the Company

### Reports to Stockholders (Including Interim News Releases)

**The chief source of statistical data is the reports issued to the stockholders.**

The ruling policy of public-utility companies varies between *quarterly* and *monthly* statements.

Figures regularly include:

- gross
- net after taxes
- balance for dividends

**Publication of results quarterly is considered as the standard procedure in nearly all lines of industry.**

**Every listed company publishes an annual report of some kind.**

- **The distinguishing feature of the annual report, however, is that it invariably presents the balance-sheet position.**

The form of the balance sheet is better standardized than the income account, and it does not offer such frequent grounds for criticism.

### Periodic Reports to Public Agencies

Railroads and most public utilities are required to supply information to various federal and state commissions.

- usually more detailed than the statements to shareholders

### Listing Applications

In pre-S.E.C. days these were the most important nonperiodic sources of information.

They were required by the New York Stock Exchange.

### Registration Statements and Prospectuses

These data are contained in registration statements filed with the Commission in Washington and available for inspection or obtainable in copy upon payment of a fee.

There is no doubt that this material is proving of the greatest value to the analyst and through him to the investing public.
