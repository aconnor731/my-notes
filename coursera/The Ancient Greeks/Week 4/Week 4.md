## Week 4 / Lecture 1: The End of Athenian Tyranny and the Democratic Revolution

- Pisistratus was such a good ruler that Aristotle had to give him his own category
  - Aristotle established him as "half-bad" as he was a tyrant but generally a good tyrant
- Pisistratus died in 528
- His two sons ruled after him: Hipparchus and Hippias
  - at least initially, this tandem rule seemed to have succeeded
  - then things went bad
- Harmodius and Aristogeiton killed the tyrant Hipparchus at a festival in 514 BCE
  - this becomes famous as the tyrannicide
- Thucydides thought this came from a personal insult
  - Harmodius rejected Hipparchus' advances
  - Hipparchus forbayed Harmodius sister from participating in the procession, suggesting she was not a virgin
- tyranny does not end after Hipparchus is killed
- both Harmodius and Aristogeiton were killed
- Hippias was much more strict and paranoid
- In 511, he was expelled
- Spartan king Kleomenes and helped an Athenian politician Isagoras, and Kleomenes manages to capture some of Hippias' family, leveraging him to leave Athens
- The Athenian Revolution [J. Ober]

1. Isagoras & Kleomenes attempt to dissolve the Boule
2. The Boule resists
3. Kleomenes and Isagoras occupy the Acropolis, with Spartan help
4. The rest of the Athenians unite. [Aristotle: "The crowd gathered itself together."]
5. They besiege the Spartan occupiers
6. Kleomenes surrenders on the 3rd day of the siege, and the Spartans withdraw.



**Important theme: without a leader, a people overthrow to establish a democracy.**

## Week 4 / Lecture 2: The Reforms of Kleisthenes

- Kleisthenes was the man the people of Athens wanted to put into power
  - he was part of the Alcmeinedes
- after the departure of the Spartans, the people chose Kleisthenes
- undertook a wholesale reconstruction of the Athenian constitution
- Kleisthenes' Reforms 1:
  - 3 regions: city, coast, inland
  - each divided into ten artificial trittyes - "thirds" (so thirty in all)
  - each trittys includes a variable number of demes, pre-existing "neighborhoods" (some 170 in all)
  - ten new tribes (phylai), each consisting of 3 trittyes, one from each region
  - new council, boule, of 500 men, serving for one year; 50 from each tribe, selected by lot
  - prytany system: council year is divided into tenths, with each tribe's council members serving as executive committee (prytaneis) for that allotted period
  - **he dealt a death blow to the previously existing clans who had power**
  - he split up the wealth geographically
  - being in a Deme was the most important for identification, once inducted into a Deme, you became a citizen
    - principal function was determining who belonged to the politeia
- the new civic heart is now the **Boule**
  - a citizen could serve in the Boule twice in his lifetime
  - the Boule created legislation to send to the assembly, also declared war
  - scrutinized magistrates after their time in office
  - a group of 500 is a little too large to get anything done
  - Kleisthenes split up the civic year into 10 parts
  - one citizen in the Boule, for 24 hours, was an overseer
  - this must have required some type of accounting/census

- Kleisthenes' Reforms 2:
  - Ekklesia - Assembly, including all citizens, who were guaranteed freedom of speech, meaning if you wanted to accomplish a lot, you had to be a great persuader
  - Magistrates:
    - 9 Archons - served one year, examined by Boule, and passed into the...
    - 10 Strategoi (Generals) -- elected annually, one from each tribe (Peracles) was a general over and over, no limit where Archon has limit, elected annually, one from each tribe
    - Popular courts
    - Ostracism: official process, early in the year, assembly was asked if they wanted an ostracism, later on in the year, they would hold a vote among 6,000, one individual's name would be inscribed and the citizen who got the most votes had to leave Athens for 10 years, could not be appealed
      - **one of the most democratic mechanism according to Aristotle**
      - could be used as a political weapon against their opponents
      - no evidence to how it was conducted, around 508-507 BCE
    - Isonomia: condition of "equal law" and equality under the law
- Kleisthenes laid the foundation for the democracy in Athens, that would lead to much democracy in the West
