# Greek and Roman Mythology, Week 2

## 2.1 On Reading Homer, Part 2

Books 1 through 8

The beginning starts with grandeur.

This epic brings together large and grand happenings with small details that are personal.

Homer ends book one with a small grace note: the click of a door closing.

## 2.2 Telemachus' Troubles

Books 1 through 4.

Story will be told according to the thread of Telemachus.

We will learn about Odysseus' house: Ithaca and Penelope, mostly through the eyes of Telemachus.

Telemachus will teach us the negative aspects of the hero: since he is a young man (20 years old).

His father has been gone for 10 years of fighting and 10 years of wandering, not quite back yet.

In the Greek take of this, 20 years old is plenty old enough. Achilles was around this age when he was conquering on the battlefield.

Telemachus is in repose when telling us the story: not quite ready to act.

When we meet Telemachus, he is daydreaming. Athena makes contact with her in disguise. Then we jump into his head.

He is waiting for a miracle to happen, something impossible. Instead, a hero typically gets things done.

Telemachus blames what is happening on the Gods.

Telemachus says bards are not to blame, he blames Zeus.

Heroes typically do not blame the Gods for things that are happening in the world.

There is a certain kind of determinism: if Zeus wants something to happen, it happens.

Not fatalism though. Fatalism is not the stuff of Heroes.

The more engaged, the more heroic. The less engaged, the less heroic.

p. 78, Zeus says the people need to get active and take action, not sit idly and waiting for intervention from the Gods.

Telemachus needs some guidance. The help he gets is Athena disguised as a mentor, Mentees.

- Mentor comes from "Mentees," the proper name.

Athena brings Telemachus on a journey so he can kind of grow up.

Athena as a helper of youth.

Book 1: Telemachus feels sorry for himself and is daydreaming. At the end, he calls an assembly. It is a sad result. The people in the crowd feel sorry for him. They do not engage after Telemachus fulminates and gesticulates while asking them to engage.

## 2.3 Telemachus' Tour

p. 87, Athena says to Telemachus, "You must not cling to your boyhood any longer. It is time for you to become a man!"

Heading out on this tour with his Mentees (Athena in disguise)

They started thinking their ancestors were greater than they due to these great citadels. They thought only a large cyclops could do this.

Law #1: Nostalgia is the most powerful force in the universe.

Telemachus journeys from Ithaca to Pylos and sees 9 divisions of 500 people each. Each division is slaughtering 9 bulls. So 81 bulls are being slaughtered on a beach.

- this is extraordinary to Telemachus
- the wealth is grandiose (each bull is worth a lot)
- he starts to think this is the type of grandeur that should be in his household

Telemachus' emotions needs some calibration. He needs some schooling. The audience is angry and he needs to learn it is okay to be angry.

Arestes

These elders are reacting to this powerlessness. "Have you heard the one about Arestes?"

If someone kills your father, you should kill your father's killer.

On Homer's accord, Arestes did what he needed to do, with killing his father's killer.

While Telemachus is being schooled, he is being introduced to the right emotional response (anger for this happening in his household)

- introduced to the aristocratic
- go and be the Arestes of your own story

Telemachus visits Nestor

Telemachus visits the house of Menelaes where we see the beauty of Helen

Helen:

- beauty
- intoxication
- bring you out of this world
- erotic power
- magic (narcotic mixture in beverage)

Travelling was how Telemachus gained knowledge.

King Menelaus is also angry at what is happening in Telemachus' household. He is helping school Telemachus on how to feel in these circumstances.

Older elder figures, like Zeus, mention Orestes since he did not feel helpless and killed his father's murderer.

To Homer, Orestes had the gumption to do what needed to be done, that is killing his father's murderer, which is in line with the ethics of Greece.

## 2.4: Odysseus on Ogygia
