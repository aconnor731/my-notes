# Lecture 8: The Oresteia: Libation Bearers and Eumenides

- Libation Bearers, develops the key themes of duties and irreconcilable claims to those duties
- opening lines of Libation Bearers are missing
- Libation Bearers gets its name from its chorus, slave women carrying libations (honey, wine)
- when Electra arrives at Agamemnon's grave/tomb, she finds a lock of hair, that is her brother Orestes
- Electra's main purpose in this play is to strengthen the resolve of her brother Orestes
- Orestes pretends to be a messenger to gain entry to the palace of Clytamnaestra and tells her Orestes has been murdered
- when she realizes he is the killer come for her, she takes up her masculine side in calling for an axe to kill her son, before going back to her femininity to plead to her son not to kill his own mother
- then, she tries to persuade or argue him out of killing her
- Orestes does not claim that he is right to kill her, instead he claims she was wrong to kill his father, her husband
- after killing, he claims he was somewhat right, but is not certain and nervous
- immediately, Orestes sees the Furies coming to punish him for killing his mother
- Orestes tells his sister Electra that the oracle of Apollo told him if he did not kill his mother, he will be punished with madness and illness, and if he does, the Furies will punish him with madness and illness
- simply by being born Orestes, some god will torture him

## Eumenides

- reconciles what proceeds of the curse of the house of Atreus, specifically, the murder of Clytamnaestra by her son Orestes
- one issue Aeschylus explores through the house of Aeschylus is the court system, giving up the accused to a court system
- he cannot avenge his father without murdering his mother, there is no course he can take without some new system, the court system
- Orestes, in Athens, becomes the first ever defendant in the first every trial of western court systems
- Athena is the judge
  - any case that an individual can solve proceeds to a jury to solve
- a tied vote amounts to an acquittal in an Athenian murder trial
- it is uncertain whether there are an even or odd number of jurors
- scholars will probably continue to disagree of the number of jurors, whether humans, left to their own capacity, will cling to the old ways, of blood vengeance
- **Eumenides**: "kindly ones," Athena gives the Furies a new role so that their powers are not completely removed by Orestes' acquittal
- **Areopagus Council**
  - Areopagus: hill of Ares
- talks about the issue of shifting power between the sexes

| female          | male                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| unfettered rage | reason, logic, rationality |

- Apollo says that the mother is not actually the parent of a child, more the ground that nourishes the seed
- Apollo is asserting a Greek male desire that men should be able to reproduce without women
- two features that do not fit: Clytamnaestra and Athena
  - Clytamnaestra is both male and female
  - Athena is female, but outlook is notably male
    - she is female, so she is able to persuade the Furies
  - both cannot be categorized as male or female
- young Olympian gods have won the day, the old "chtonic" gods are not completely removed, but reassigned
