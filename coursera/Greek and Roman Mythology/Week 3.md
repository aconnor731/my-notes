## Week 3

### 3.1: Odysseus and the Cyclops

Books 9-12: Some of the best parts of the Odyssey

- His hosts still don't know his identity, he is explaining himself now...
- name, lineage, where are you from (answers right at the beginning), his past
  - he goes on to tell his stories with more detail
- Odysseus becomes the bard of the tale
- most important stories come in 3:
  - book 9: Ciconians, the lotus-eaters (Lotophagi), the Cyclops
    - short, short, long
  - book 10: Aeolus, Lastrygonians, Circe
    - short, short, very long
  - book 11: long journey into the underworld
  - book 12: Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, and cattle of the sun
    - short, short, and long
- look for temptation, curiosity and gaining knowledge
  - Odysseus is passionately curious and desires to gain knowledge
- watch out for food crimes of all kinds
  - things are being treated as foods that should not be eaten
- humans will become animals
- Odysseus is searching for knowledge
- when he goes to the underworld, he discovers there is an important secret that explains why things are happening to you. Go to the underworld to find out.
- Heroes don't want to sit back and relax (retire early and play golf)

#### Odysseus and the Cyclops

- features of the Cyclops
  - strange clumping of creatures
  - they are missing a lot of things
    - they don't have cultivation or settled farming technology
    - they don't have wheat or bread so they need to get their nutrition from somewhere else
    - they don't have counsels: they don't form alliances to help each other solve problems
    - no homes, just caves: a huge sign of lack of civilization
    - most remarkable, they don't know how to build ships so they do not meet a lot of different people that are different from them
    - they entirely lack xenia
      - this is a recurring thing
    - they don't understand the guest relationship
      - they asked Polyphemus for a gift and he receives none
    - Odysseus gives the Cyclops his own gift that he received from Meron, subverting him by debilitating him
    - Odysseus and his men receive no gift from the Cyclops so Odysseus gives him a gift to debilitate him
    - the giant, instead of demonstrating xenia and offering his guests food, he uses Odysseus' own men as food (very bad manners)
    - Cyclops is not only ignoring the rules of xenia, he is perverting them
    - **Universal law #3: It is not good to be food.**
      - it is so awful to consider as humans, it is revolting and disgusting
    - reminds us that animals survive by eating other living things
    - we like to think that we are not just part of the food chain
- Odysseus cleverly decides to debilitate rather than kill the giant, since they cannot escape if they killed him
- Another trick of Odysseus, he responds when asked for his name with "Nobody." So when the Cyclops' friends, they think he is fine because he says, "Nobody is hurting me."
- Odysseus then adopts this pure anonymity, the name of no name
  - in some ways, he loses his name with the Cyclops episode
  - not though quite well enough
  - it marks his entry into this new strange world of anonymity
- like great Heroes, he can't stand the fact that the Cyclops might not know who beat him. He then tells him his name, giving Polyphemus the means to call down a terrible curse. Without the name, he would be powerless to do it. He calls upon his dad, Poseidon, to take care of Odysseus (bad mistake Odysseus)
- **Cyclops represents an important lesson on the importance of xenia**
  - he is a perfect example of what not to do
  - Greeks can sit back and listen and dwell upon the proper way of hosting guests (you don't want to act like a Cyclops)

### 3.2 Cycle Two: Circe

- King Aeolus, has a bag of wind
  - his six sons and daughters are married to each other
- Circe turns Odysseus' men into pigs
  - it is awful to have our humanity taken away from them
  - they are also in the standard repertoire of the food chain
- Men who made this myth fear that a woman can turn a man into a pig, unman a man, strip away his courage.
- Another example of the recurring theme of dangerous women with magical power/aura.
- Circe is overjoyed that Odysseus overpowers her. A year-long tryst occurs and he doesn't want to leave. His men had to convince him to leave.
- Before leaving, Circe gives him secret knowledge that is in the underworld.
- She instructs him how to bait the dead with a combination of libations so he can interview them to find his way to find his way to Tigerious
- they don't even know that one of their crew mates has drank too much, fell, and died
  - this will be important for the future

### 3.3: The Underworld

- the underworld is not under anything, it is far away
- it is so far away, it is not like Dante's so far down
- sulfurous
- these shades need blood as life would return to them, re-embodied, allowing them to speak
- the Greeks would much rather be alive than dead
- ethical scores are not settled in the underworld, they are not being judged, they are floating around, a place you don't want to be (like being on a layover in an airport)
- Tantalus and Sisyphus are the exceptions as they are being eternally punished
- Elpenor tells Odysseus he must bury him, Homer is legitimizing the importance of burial for the dead
- Tiresias is Apollo's priest, has deep wisdom for both the future, present, and past
- Tiresias tells him he must apologize to Poseidon
- Odysseus must take an oar so far inland so people do not recognize it and then build a temple to Poseidon
- Remember, Odysseus is telling this story to Alcinous so when Alcinous suddenly chimes in, it is logically sound
- Agamemnon's son Orestes corrects things by murdering his father's murderer
- The killing of Achilles does not happen in the Illiad, Homer explains it here
- Achilles tells Odysseus he would rather be a slave and still alive than be the grand person that I am and be locked down in here with the dead
