# Greek and Roman Mythology, Week 2

## 2.1 On Reading Homer, Part 2

Books 1 through 8

The beginning starts with grandeur.

This epic brings together large and grand happenings with small details that are personal.

Homer ends book one with a small grace note: the click of a door closing.

## 2.2 Telemachus' Troubles

Books 1 through 4.

Story will be told according to the thread of Telemachus.

We will learn about Odysseus' house: Ithaca and Penelope, mostly through the eyes of Telemachus.

Telemachus will teach us the negative aspects of the hero: since he is a young man (20 years old).

His father has been gone for 10 years of fighting and 10 years of wandering, not quite back yet.

In the Greek take of this, 20 years old is plenty old enough. Achilles was around this age when he was conquering on the battlefield.

Telemachus is in repose when telling us the story: not quite ready to act.

When we meet Telemachus, he is daydreaming. Athena makes contact with her in disguise. Then we jump into his head.

He is waiting for a miracle to happen, something impossible. Instead, a hero typically gets things done.

Telemachus blames what is happening on the Gods.

Telemachus says bards are not to blame, he blames Zeus.

Heroes typically do not blame the Gods for things that are happening in the world.

There is a certain kind of determinism: if Zeus wants something to happen, it happens.

Not fatalism though. Fatalism is not the stuff of Heroes.

The more engaged, the more heroic. The less engaged, the less heroic.

p. 78, Zeus says the people need to get active and take action, not sit idly and waiting for intervention from the Gods.

Telemachus needs some guidance. The help he gets is Athena disguised as a mentor, Mentees.

- Mentor comes from "Mentees," the proper name.

Athena brings Telemachus on a journey so he can kind of grow up.

Athena as a helper of youth.

Book 1: Telemachus feels sorry for himself and is daydreaming. At the end, he calls an assembly. It is a sad result. The people in the crowd feel sorry for him. They do not engage after Telemachus fulminates and gesticulates while asking them to engage.

## 2.3 Telemachus' Tour

p. 87, Athena says to Telemachus, "You must not cling to your boyhood any longer. It is time for you to become a man!"

Heading out on this tour with his Mentees (Athena in disguise)

Citadel of Mycenae, "the Lion's Gate" pictured

They started thinking their ancestors were greater than they due to these great citadels. They thought only a large cyclops could do this.

Law #1: Nostalgia is the most powerful force in the universe.

Telemachus journeys from Ithaca to Pylos and sees 9 divisions of 500 people each. Each division is slaughtering 9 bulls. So 81 bulls are being slaughtered on a beach.

- this is extraordinary to Telemachus
- the wealth is grandiose (each bull is worth a lot)
- he starts to think this is the type of grandeur that should be in his household

Telemachus' emotions needs some calibration. He needs some schooling. The audience is angry and he needs to learn it is okay to be angry.

Arestes

These elders are reacting to this powerlessness. "Have you heard the one about Arestes?"

If someone kills your father, you should kill your father's killer.

On Homer's accord, Arestes did what he needed to do, with killing his father's killer.

While Telemachus is being schooled, he is being introduced to the right emotional response (anger for this happening in his household)

- introduced to the aristocratic
- go and be the Arestes of your own story

Telemachus visits Nestor

Telemachus visits the house of Menelaes where we see the beauty of Helen

Helen:

- beauty
- intoxication
- bring you out of this world
- erotic power
- magic (narcotic mixture in beverage)

Travelling was how Telemachus gained knowledge.

King Menelaus is also angry at what is happening in Telemachus' household. He is helping school Telemachus on how to feel in these circumstances.

Older elder figures, like Zeus, mention Orestes since he did not feel helpless and killed his father's murderer.

To Homer, Orestes had the gumption to do what needed to be done, that is killing his father's murderer, which is in line with the ethics of Greece.

## 2.4: Odysseus on Ogygia

Odysseus is feeling sorry for himself, like Telemachus was, as he was being held by force by a beautiful nymph, Calypso, who desires him.

Books 5 through 8 will be about Odysseus in the same manner that we followed Telemachus in books 1-4.

Zeus' power comes from his violence. People/Gods/Goddesses are frightened by him.

"Calypso": to hide

She gives him tools. With tools, Odysseus can do anything.

Heroes are just good at things. They have skills. They get things done.

Odysseus is now gaining back some of the things that he lost over the last 7 years.

Why is Poseidon so angry with Odysseus? We will learn.

Odysseus lands at the beach naked, with having only his ticking heart.

Odysseus uses his craftsmanship to build a shelter by gathering leaves and placing them beneath olive bush springs.

Odysseus gets his rest after a long book of stress. Athena places sleep on his eyes. 

### 2.5: Odysseus on Scheria

- beautiful young women around a pond or river is the archetype in Western literature
- In book 5, Odysseus has been suffering. Through book 6 and beyond, we seem him endure.
- after surviving the voyage to the shore, he now must figure out what to do next.
- he is without clothes, which means he will have to figure out how to get clothes.
- he also needs to regain his speech.
- the young women are doing laundry
- Odysseus looks terrible and has nothing. He has to figure out how to rejoin human society.
- He will have to use his words.
- He is a master of persuasion and the arts of language.
- he needs an ally to help him find his way back into society while he is in this abject state.
  - to do this, he must use his words
- Odysseus needs to persuade Nausicaa
- **Universal Law 2: If you want to persuade people, you must know your audience.**
- He could have explained what has happened to his life, but he chooses not to do that.
- He needs to get inside the head of his audience, Nausicaa.
- He looks for ways to make her feel good. 
  - Flattery is a great way to start a persuasive speech.
  - Charm: express yourself in a way that is honest to your own situation.
- He starts with a speech to soften her with respect to her ability to make a connection with him.
  - Line 160, Odysseus first speaking to Nausicaa: "Here I am at your mercy, princess - are you a goddess or a mortal? If one of the gods who rule the skies up there, you're Artemis to the life, the daughter of mighty Zeus - I see her now - just look at your build, your bearing, your lithe flowing grace...But if you're one of the mortals living here on earth, three times blest are your father, your queenly mother, three times over your brothers too. How often their hearts must warm with joy to see you striding into the dances - such a bloom of beauty. True, but he is the one more blest than all other men alive, that man who sways you with gifts and leads you home, his bride! I have never laid eyes on anyone like you, neither man nor woman...I look at you and a sense of wonder takes me.
    Wait, once I saw the like - in Delos, beside Apollo's altar - the young slip of a palm-tree springing into the light. There I'd sailed, you see, with a great army in my wake, out on the long campaign that doomed my life to hardship. That vision! Just as I stood there gazing, rapt, for hours...no shaft like that had ever risen up from the earth - so now I marvel at *you*, my lady: rapt, enthralled, too struck with awe to grasp you by the knees though pain has ground me down.
    Only yesterday, the twentieth day, did I escape the wine-dark sea. Till then the waves and the rushing gales had swept me on from the island of Ogygia. Now some power has tossed me here, doubtless to suffer still more torments on your shores. I can't believe they''' stop. Long before that the gods will give me more, still more.
    Compassion - princess, please! You, after all that I have suffered, you are the first I've come to. I know no one else, none in your city, no one in your land. Show me the way to town, give me a rag for cover, just some cloth, some wrapper you carried with you here. And may the good gods give you all your heart desires: husband, and house, and lasting harmony too.
    No finer, greater gift in the world than that...when man and woman posses their home, two minds, two hearts that work as one. Despair to their enemies, a joy to all their friends. Their own best claim to glory."
- Ends with a hint of marriage
- he does it in a meek way
- Athena is planting the idea in the princess' head that some eligible man might wash up on shore so Nausicaa should have clean clothes.
- He needs to make an alliance to get back into human society.
  - It is a microcosm of what human society is all about: we meet people, they need things. As a great leader, a great hero, the hero provides those things to the people that the hero meets. In doing so, carrying other people's water, that hero gets a chance to do other kinds of things to work themselves into the kind of position of exaltation in society. Only because he earns it in social situations.
- Odysseus then moves from the periphery to the center when he moves from the wilderness to the halls of society.

### 2.6: Alcinous

Scheria is an island

Gods talk to the Phaecians face-to-face, a unique thing.

Homer uses something called **Ring Composition** where someone begins talking about A, then digresses to talking about B, then finishes by returning to A.

- he uses this when Odysseus enters the threshold of Alcinous, pauses to show the grandeur of the wealth he sees, and then returns to the threshold

### 2.7: Knee-Grabbing and Xenia

Odysseus lunges and grabs hold of the queens knees

- in ancient Greek customs, doing this gives him instance status as a guest-friend. It makes you their suppliant and they owe you guest-friendship and hospitality that is required of a Greek for their guest-friends. This entitles you to all kinds of good stuff if they are good hosts. If they aren't, you don't know what you will receive.
- xenia: extraordinary hospitality for a guest washing up on your shore
  - it is sacred of aristocratic Greek behavior
  - the more lavish, the more you are practicing xenia
  - you demonstrate your own status by what you give
  - games, feasts, marry my daughter, inherit my kingdom, other overwhelming gifts
  - they don't get anything back from the Stranger, Odysseus. All he has to do is go along with it. They don't even ask his name until after they have lavished him with gifts.
- Why practice xenia? **Trade**

### 2.8: Functionalism

- While Odysseus is receiving lavish gifts on Scheria from the Phaecians
- What makes a myth a myth?
  - 4 specific schools of thought: **functionalism**, structuralism, psychoanalysis, and myth and ritual
    - use each to tinker with myths to help understand them
- functionalism: **Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942)**
  - found that myths legitimize some kind of underlying social and cultural norms that they hold dear: they serve a function.
  - they serve a purpose
  - they are there to reassure us that our cultural norms are right for us
  - **myths serve the role of legitimizing**
  - myths are not interested in unveiling of deep, human truth. They are interested in the specifics of individual cultures.
- we are not interested in the origin of the myth. We are concerned with how cultures use it now.

### 2.9: Reassembling the Hero

- in these books, we are rebuilding the hero, Odysseus
- King Alcinous has hinted that he is disgruntled with Nausicaa since he walked in by himself, not accompanied by her
  - Odysseus quickly tells King Alcinous a white lie that he wanted to go in alone
- Odysseus knows when to draw a line, and how to enforce
  - a good quality to being a good hero: know when to give and when to draw a line
- When Broadsea comes back to apologize, Odysseus graciously accepts his apology and his gift of a sword
- Hero:
  - endures
  - intelligent
  - great craftsmen
  - crafty, sneaky, he has already lied a lot, but for important reasons
  - strong
  - not a merchant, you have to better equipped for on the battlefield
- the heroic qualities only can be discovered through experience
- by the end of book 8, he is still anonymous to the Phaecians
- name, lineage, the land you are from, and finally your past
- Odysseus is about to take control of the narrative in books 9-12 in explaining his heritage and where he has been

### 2.10: Poetry and Democodus

- Demodocus, a poet introduced in book 8

- Homer shows us how poets fit into society through Demodocus
- has a role of an entertainer
- can do extraordinary things, for instance, great memory



One commentator's views: Heraclitus (1<sup>st</sup> century C.E.)

Union of love (Aphrodite) and strife (Ares)

- Divine laughter since it is a cause for joy

Commentary on blacksmithing

- Fire (Hephaestus) softens iron (Ares)
- Need to apply passion (Aphrodite) to the work
- Water (Poseidon) pulls the iron out and cools it off

Another commentator Cornutus (1<sup>st</sup> century C.E.)

- Ares + Aphrodite = Adultery
- The brutal and violent do not correspond well with the cheery and gentle, nor is one naturally intertwined with another. But there is a noble offspring from this: harmony.

Final commentator, *Life of Homer* Author (1<sup>st</sup> century C.E.) (thought to be Plutarch)

- Ares and Aphrodite are love and strife, and they are sometimes together (then there is harmony) and sometimes apart.
- Helios denounces them, Hephaestus chains them, and Poseidon, water, frees them. It is clear from this that the hot, dry essence and its opposite, cold wet one, sometimes draw the universe together and sometimes pull it apart.

Books 9-12 includes some of the strangest parts of the Odyssey.
