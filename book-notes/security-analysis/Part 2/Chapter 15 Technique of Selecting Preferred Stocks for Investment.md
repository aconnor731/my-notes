# Chapter 15: Technique of Selecting Preferred Stocks for Investment

**<u>An investment preferred issue must meet all the requirements of a good bond, with an extra margin of safety to offset its contractual disadvantages.</u>**

### Minimum Average-Earnings Coverage

| Class of enterprise | For investment bonds     | For investment preferred stocks                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Public utilities    | 1.75 times fixed charges | 2 times fixed charges plus preferred dividends   |
| Railroads           | 2 times fixed charges    | 2.5 times fixed charges plus preferred dividends |
| Industrials         | 3 times fixed charges    | 4 times fixed charges plus preferred dividends   |

- these increases in the earnings coverage suggest that a corresponding advance should be made in the stock-value ratio

These may be overly stringent criteria, but until such stabilization has actually been discernible over a considerable period of time the attitude of investors towards preferred stocks must remain extremely critical and exacting.

In the case of all the *industrial* issues listed on page 192, the stock-value ratio at its lowest exceeded 1.6 to 1, and also that the average earnings coverage exceeded 5.6 times.

### Mere Presence of Funded Debt Does Not Disqualify Preferred Stocks for Investment

### Total-deductions Basis of Calculation Recommended.

In calculating the earnings coverage for preferred stocks with bonds preceding, **it is absolutely essential that the <u>bond interest and preferred dividend be taken *together*</u>.**

If the preferred stock issue is much smaller than the funded debt, the earnings per share will indicate that the preferred dividend is earned more times than is the bond interest.

**The real point is that where a company has both bonds and preferred stock the preferred stock can be safe enough *only if the bonds are much safer than necessary.***

Suggested minimum for preferred-dividend coverage: **4 times**.

*"Dollars-per-share" Formula Misleading.*

When a preferred stock has no bonds ahead of it, the earnings may be presented in two ways, with the **second form being distinctly preferable**:

- so many dollars per share
- **so may times dividend requirements**
  - preferable because:
    - the "dollars-per-share" formula is mistakenly used when bonds do exist when it should be used when they do not
      - may be best to drop the dollars-per-share form of calculation entirely
    - **secondly, the significance of the dollars earned per share is dependent upon the market price of the preferred stock.**
      - earnings of $20 per share would be much more favorable for a preferred issue selling at **80** than for a preferred selling at **125**.
        - in the first case, earnings are **25%**, and in the other only **16%**, on the market price.

### Calculation of the Stock-value Ratio.

### Noncumulative Issues.

*Chief Objection to Noncumulative Provision.*

**It permits the directors to withhold dividends even in good years, when they are amply earned, the money thus saved inuring to the benefit of the common stockholders.**

### Features of the List of 21 Preferred Issues of Investment Grade.

Out of some 440 preferred stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1932, **only 40, or 9%, were noncumulative.**

*Amount Rather Than Mere Presence of Senior Obligations Important.*

It is not the mere *presence* of bonds outstanding, but rather the *amount* of the prior debt which is of serious moment.

**<u>An outstanding record for a long period in the past, plus strong evidence of inherent stability, plus the absence of any concrete reason to expect a substantial change for the worse in the future, afford probably the only sound basis available for the selection of a *fixed-value* investment.</u>**
