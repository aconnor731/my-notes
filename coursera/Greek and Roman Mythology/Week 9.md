# Week 9

## 9.1: Myth and History

- What it means to be a Roman will be a theme
- Editing, and how we do it
- Accuracy is important
- Then, is focusing on these particular events a fair representation of the past
- Consider the atrocities of WW2. Yes, atrocities technically occurred on both sides. But that seems more of a mis-characterization.

## 9.2: Myth, History, and Virgil

- Virgil lived from 70 to 19 BCE (1<sup>st</sup> century BCE)
- Saying he lived through a tumultuous time would not begin to describe the environment during this period
- The Roman Empire has amassed to a substantially large portion of the world, with countless cultures mixed within it
- Romans are rightfully amazed, they are top dog in the Mediterranean
- To be a Roman
  - You have experienced a fratricidal Rome, many civil wars, nasty, awful wars
  - the Roman Republic is now gone
  - What it means to be Roman is unsure and is up for grabs
  - what comes next
- Augustus, rules Rome as the first Emperor
  - proclaims himself carrying forward old traditions when he really is making things anew
  - supports the arts, poets, with Virgil among them
  - he shares the view with Virgil of a new sense of what it is to be Roman
  - this brings this form of epic poetry
  - Virgil's poetic form works in tandem with Augustus' political project
- Many histories to Rome
- Aeneas, we've met him in Homer's hymn to Aphrodite and the Iliad
- Homeric hymn to Aphrodite:
  - Aeneas is born when Zeus is fed up with Aphrodite's mischievousness and making gods fall in love with mortals.
  - he makes it happen to Aphrodite
  - she is embarassed with falling in love with Anchises, producing Aeneas
  - Aeneas has immortal blood, but it is kind of a revenge against Aphrodite for having her weaken all those immortals by making them fall in love with mortals. Same thing's now happens to her.
  - his divine blood makes him pretty grand, not on the same level of other ancient mortal heroes.
  - early Romans hang on to this history, that Aeneas was a founding father of this city of Rome
- Other well-known stories of Rome's past:
  - Romulus and Remus, from a wolf
  - they were understood to be founders of the city of Rome back in the 8th century BCE
  - they understand their city came from this pair of twins.
  - Rome is founded when Romulus kills Remus
  - complicated history of Rome
  - that's not the one that Virgil latches onto
- instead, Aeneas returns for him
- there are names in the past Rome's, that show up behind Rome:
  - first settlement of Levinium
  - city of Alba Longa, settlement set out to found Rome
  - Latium, an ancient civilization
- all these terms are reverborating around
- before Virgil, there wasn't a solidifed authoritative narrative that strung them all together.
- Well does that
- remember Hesiod aligning all the different possibilities of divine relationships with one another through a genealogical chart, he makes sense out of this past history
- Virgil does the same, using Aeneas as a foundation
- Rome was the undisputed power in the ancient Mediterranean, something everyone agreed upon.
- Augustus sat as founder of a massive and massively successful empire
- Virgil begins to bury himself inside of this legend around Aeneus and look to a Trojan background to what it means to be Roman
- it is not very accurate that Romans had ties to Troy, but this sense of antiquity that's built into them
- not likely that there are familial lineage between Troy and Rome
- Romans chose them, **definitely not the Greeks**
- Romans thought of the Trojans before Virgil
- Virgil develops this to what Romanness is all about
- They also get something else, that they get a position that is not swallowed up by the Greeks.
- no biological background to the Greeks, their sworn enemies
- they choose a biological background to the Trojans, however
- Are they affiliating themselves to those who failed in battle?
- Virgil, talks about an early loss, now Roman is undisputed, they don't have pesky Greece around to bother them
- Romans have a cultural anxiety with respect to Greek greatness
- From Horace's "Epistle 2": `Graecia capta ferum victorum cepit`: "Greece after it was captured, the ferocious victor."
- After the Romans conquer the Greeks, they get excited by their culture, affiliating to the other side, the Trojans
- the cultural anxiety, the professor thinks, is getting worked out by making a connection with a grand past that Homer talks about but affiliating with the other side, the non-Greek side.
- this is perfectly fine for the Romans, despite being sworn enemies
- the sense of the Roman and Greek connection with a contemporary connection: 
  - some Americans admire things that happened in older cultures, European nations, those from England in particular
- We admire that, but we are culturally anxious about it
- we feel they are more sophisticated than us due to their older culture
- some resentment, from this feeling that they are superior to us
- not based on much reality, just people's fantasies
- so as in ancient Rome
- drawing the linkage of Aeneas to Rome's founding started a cottage industry for Roman aristocrats to find Trojan linkages for themselves
- all of this is the cultural stew that Virgil is entering when he tells a story
- Virgil says yes you indeed did come from the Trojans. Aeneas is the founder of our whole national identity
