## Week 5

### 5.1: Introducing the Greek Gods

- the Gods were indeed born
- the time period we will be concerned with will be before the world is born

### 5.2: Hesiod and Ancient Near East Connections

- Sumerians and Babylonians were around millenia before the Greeks
- many peoples occupied the "fertile crescent"
- Epic of Gilgamesh, Sumerian Epic, the oldest Epic known to man
- generations overflow older ones is a common themes throughout these cultures' stories
- Homer is more isolated versus the interconnectedness of Hesiod

### 5.3: Intro to Hesiod

- with Hesiod, we are carrying forward with Greek epic poetry.
- both use this special diction of dactylic hexameter meter
- begin the thought that the Greeks are one collective identity
  - Homer and Hesiod are very important to this
- Homer emphasizes the Heroes, Hesiod emphasizes the gods
- Hesiod does not focus on a narrative, unlike Homer, the master storyteller
- lists are very prominent in Hesiod
- alphabet was arriving during Hesiod's time
- Hesiod connects
- sense of grandeur in epics, totality
  - everything that is important to remember will be in the epic poem
  - the most full cultural repository one can find
- geneology is important
  - main structuring device for how poetry is supposed to work
  - not just of humans, but of the universe
  - order from chaos using geneology
- Hesiod's story does not have a single narrative much like how a family tree does not have a single narrative
- different versions of Aphrodite's birth between Homer and Hesiod
- differences in the births of the gods between Hesiod and Homer
- Hesiod makes sure it all fits in
- Hesiod wants to unveil the deep secrets of the past whereas Homer wants to explain the great deeds of the past
- there isn't one, single true version of these myths
- Hesiod is well-fed in antiquity and is authoritative
- collection of disparate tales and occasionally, one comes along and marks a large stamp (as we will see with Ovid)

### 5.4 Hesiod's Opening Hymn to the Muses

- lived in central Greece
- father came from modern-day Turkey
  - we think he made a living at farming
- Hesiod says he became a poet from the Muses that came down from Mt. Helicon
- Hesiod has sort of an almanac theme in his "Works and Days"
- Hesiod doesn't just jump into the middle of the story like Homer does, he starts by praising the Muses for 100 lines before saying goodbye to them (which is normal for Greek hymns)
- Hesiod's opening fits the form of Homeric hymns
- Homer has a single Muse, and he becomes a conduit for that Muse
- Gives a fascinating meditation on the greatness of poetry
- Can see backwards, present, and forward, like a prophet
- Poets see things that normal people cannot and pass them on to immortalize them
- Inspires what makes a great King, Hesiod elevates the importance of Poets on the same level of kings, a poet-king
- a large purview makes a great ruler
- we learn from the poets that Muses sing truths and sing lies
- Hesiod has laid the setting for the Muses and for what is to come

### 5.5: Earth and Sky

- how might they all fit together? This is the question Hesiod worked to answer
- Hesiod's world reproduction comes through sex
- In Hesiod's world, there is a pre-beginning consisting of 4 beings:
  - **Chasm**
    - Greek name: "Chaos"
    - means "emptiness"
    - best English translation is "Chasm"
  - **Earth**
  - **Tartara**
    - an underworld, down below the regular upper world that we might know
    - it is a scary place
  - **Eros**
    - abstract sexual desire
    - not gentle love, but violent and sometimes dangerous
    - cause destruction
- They are just there, they existed since the beginning
- **Chasm** alone produces, **Erebos** and **dark Night**
- Night alone produces **Bright Air** and **Day** whom she bore in shared intimacy with **Erebos**
- The "alpha" stage (taken from software)
  - **Earth** produces **Sky** out of herself
  - **Sky** then becomes her partner
  - From them, **Titans** are born
  - Famous monsters are created, like **Cyclops** and **One-hundred hands**
- **Sky** and **Earth** are intimate with each other
- **Earth** doesn't want **Sky** to be on top of her every night because he is stopping everything that she creates from coming out
- **Sky** is also threatened by her offspring. He is trying to control it.
- **Earth** gets her children to cut off **Sky's** genitals (**Kronos** does it)
- **Kronos** hurls the genitals into the sea
- This is deeply effective at disempowering the **Sky**
- A bunch of principles/children come out of her every night
- The genitals drop blood into the ocean
  - they create the Eunauaes
  - they are blood avengers
- **Aphrodite** grows out of the foam, "aphros", from the genitals in the ocean
  - not a gentle birth
- **Parthenogenesis**: creation by oneself only
- nasty creatures come from this stage of creation
- also a long list of nymphs are created
  - not associated with any negativity or violence
-
