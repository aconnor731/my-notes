# Chapter 8: RESTful API Design Tips

- enterprise-scale applications are being built as a collection of polyglot microservices
- business-critical applications are being designed, developed, and deployed as a set of independent, yet interactive, microservices
- REST APIs also have had tremendous success for services and applications
  - web, cloud, mobile, and IoT applications are being built with REST APIs
- **Because of its simplicity and lightweight nature, the REST paradigm has captured both minds and market share in large quantities**
- Every worthwhile microservice, application, and platform is being frontended with a REST interface.
- topics this chapter will discuss with regards to design patterns for building REST APIs:
  - Articulating the importance of APIs
  - Accentuating API design patterns and best practices
  - Enumerating API security guidelines
  - Explaining the various tools and platforms associated with API design, development, integration, security, and management
  - Tending toward the API-driven digital world

### Beginning with APIs

- APIs have gained so much popularity because they expose any application or service to the outside world to find and use its unique business and technical competencies
- to integrate all these different services, middleware solutions are being implemented like: enterprise application hubs, enterprise service buses, message brokers and queues, API gateways and management suites, and service meshes
- APIs are used for every device to expose them as a service to the outside world
- an API is a kind of messenger that receives and processes requests and ensures it runs enterprise systems successfully.
- For an integrated world, setting up, composing, securing, controlling, and enhancing APIs becomes paramount for global enterprises in showcasing their distinct capabilities to their customers, partners, and employees.

### Learning about application programming interfaces

- according to experts, an API is a set of rules and tools for initiating and governing how business workloads interact
- if applications were vehicles on the road, APIs would be the traffic rules
- if applications were food items, APIs would be recipes
- forming appropriate rules for the intended success of the APIs is vital
- application integration becomes simpler with APIs
- APIs have emerged as the standard for process integration

### APIs have become indispensable
