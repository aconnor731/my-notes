# Greek and Roman Mythology

What is **myth**?

- much more than a simple definition
- deep and highly valued things by culture
- it operates as a container for which people toss what they deem as most important
- Is myth a lie or a profound truth?
- Some answers to what myth is:
  - If true: it is universally true or specific-to-culture true



Greeks had a word for myth: **mythos**

- anything that comes out of a person's mouth
- a story
  - later, more specifically, a false story
  - even later, some 1000 years after the poets, a tall tale that has a deeper truth to it



## Course Overview

- focus on a real ancient hero
- Hercules' name was invented by the Romans but its genesis came from a Greek original named Heracles
  - true Hercules is Heracles
  - but to Greeks, this was centuries old to classic Greeks
- poets add their rendition to already-told myths and stories like Homer, Ovid, and Virgil
- This course has a central, core theme on what it means to be human.
- half-human and half-animal beings
- The Gods
  - their disguises let them walk among us
  - smart people can tell that they are Gods, dumb people cannot
- when they speak about the Gods, they know they are separate from the Gods
  - they respect the Gods
- What does it mean to study myth in the contemporary world?
- The Mediterranean Sea: "The Corrupting Sea"
- One of the things this course is all about: How things are different or the same?
- "The connected mind is an intelligent mind." - Professor



### Week 1 Lecture 3: Ancient Ideas on Myth

- How people of antiquity thought about myths
- some of these people thought they needed to be censored (like Plato)
- Plato was not a friend of the poets
  - "Such utterances are both impious and false...They are furthermore harmful to those who hear them. For every man will be lenient with his own misdeeds if he is convinced that such are and were the actions of [the gods]..."
  - **Myths have the power to construct culture**
- Xenophanes [of Colophon] (6<sup>th</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup> c. BCE)
  - "...But if cattle and horses or lions had hands or were able to draw, horses would draw the forms of their gods like horses, cattle like cattle."
  - We are reflecting back into our Gods what we see in ourselves.
  - **Culture constructs myth**
- Metrodorus of Lampsacus (5<sup>th</sup> c. BCE)
  - "Neither Hera nor Athena nor Zeus are the things which those who consecrate temples and walls to them consider them to be, but they are manifestations of nature and arrangements of the elements...Agamemnon is air, Achilles is the sun, Helen is the earth and Paris the air, Hector is the moon. But among the gods, Demeter is the liver, Dionysus is the spleen, and Apollo the bile."
  - Myths are representations of truths, containing deep, hidden, and ancient wisdom.
  - Ancient readers loved to reader Homer allegorically.
  - **Allegory**
- Aristarchus of Samothrace (c. 216 - 144 BCE)
  - Aristarchus thought that readers ought to take things told by the poet as more like legends, according to poetic license, and not bother themselves about what is outside the things told by the poet.
  - **Anti-allegorical and literary**
- Euhemerus (4<sup>th</sup> - 3<sup>rd</sup> c. BCE)
  - The gods, we are told, were terrestrial beings who gained immortal honor and fame because of their gifts to humanity...Regarding these gods many and varied accounts have been handed down by the writers of history and of mythology.
  - Stories that we hear are based on real and historical figures
  - **Euhemerism**
- <u>Two most prominent theories that survive: **allegory** and **Euhemerism**.</u>



#### Week 1 Lecture 4: Ideas on Myth from the Modern Era

**Modern Era** (in this class): Renaissance and afterward

Throughout the Middle Ages, allegory and Euhemerism were prominent.

**Fabula(e)**: a story or a tale, a tall tale.

- Doesn't have much deep truth (Aesop's fables)

Bernard de Fontenelle (1657 - 1757)

- in his view, the myths grow up as a reaction of early humans to the environment around us, like strange natural structures, etc.
- myths are attempts to explain strange features of the natural landscape.

- myth is an attempt at science, or bad science.
- myths came out of human's fears

David Hume (1711 - 1776)

- he was around during the Enlightenment
- myth was not a source of great interest
- it was a result of fearful human beings that were comforting to them
- they were not worth studying for the Enlightened scientific thinkers

Christian Gottlob Heyne (1729 - 1812)

- wanted to know everything about the ancient Greeks
- he gathered a lot of background data of the ancient Greeks to help him understand them better
- myths came out of human's fears, but more-so because of awe
  - innate sense of wonder in all of us
- some new dimension of natural expression in order to express a sense of awe for their natural surroundings
- revived the ancient Greek term of "mythos" that led to the word "myth" as we know it today
- their language was very concrete of abstractions, using natural landscape around them

Johann Gottfried Herder (1744 - 1803)

- early Romanticism, sharp criticism of the Enlightened thinkers
- myths are deeply and profound truths
- most profound manifestations of the human spirit ever found
- myths were innate to human beings
- a larger capacity for human expression
- myth was identical to poetry, religion, or anything that represents what it means to be alive

Walter Burkert (1931 - 2015)

- myth is a traditional tale told with secondary partial reference to something of collective importance, Struck: <u>told by someone for some reason</u>



#### Week 1 Lecture 5: The Trojan War & The World of Homer

- Rome (1<sup>st</sup> BCE)
- Athens (5<sup>th</sup> BCE)
- Homer (8<sup>th</sup> BCE)
- Trojan War (13<sup>th</sup> BCE)

Heinrich Schliemann (1822 - 1890)

- found that there was indeed a great city at the location of Troy (somewhere in Troy)
- found evidence of cataclysmic events
- because of Schliemann, we believe the Trojan War actually happened
- Homer's version of the Trojan War may or may not correspond to the Trojan War that took place

Diving into Homer's world

- a dark world
- built on the coursing energy of war
- things are sometimes dealt with abruptly
- Homer looks at a real human experience, it is above an anti-war or war epic
- Illiad:
  - Achilles, Agamemnon, Ajax, Diomedes, Hector, Paris, Priam
  - A story of rage, particularly Greek Achilles against also Greek Agamemnon
    - inter-Greek rage
  - Agamemnon, older general, and Achilles, young and his greatest warrior, get into argument where Agamemnon insults Achilles in front of his friends
  - Achilles hates Agamemnon and wants those who fight for him to fail
  - death on every page, a piece of beautiful epic poetry
  - Homer's poem focuses on a very brief period of time
  - the backstory (or prequels) before Homer:
    - how did the Trojan War start? A legend that pre-dates Homer
      - Paris is a little of an embarrassment
        - better a master of love rather than warfare
      - Paris seduces Menelaus' (General Agamemnon's brother) wife, Helen (the face that launched a thousand ships)
      - about 100,000 soldiers in the Greek army that Agamemnon commands
      - Peleus and Thetis' wedding where Paris grants Aphrodite as most fairest (from the apple with "to the fairest.." inscribed on it) over Hera, and Athena, and asks for Aphrodite to grant his prize of Helen of Troy. Thus, this starts the Trojan War.

Priam and Achilles

- Achilles never really reconciles himself Agamemnon
- He does reconcile with the King of Troy, the greatest of the Trojans, Priam, when Priam ransoms for his son's body
  - Priam kisses the hands of his son's killer and begs for mercy from Achilles
  - Achilles grants this request and thus ends the Trojan War



#### Week 1 Lecture 6: Trojan War Aftermath and The Homer Question

- The war was awful
- The Greeks do not leave looking good
  - bad leadership
  - nasty motives
- "Nostoi": journeys home
-
