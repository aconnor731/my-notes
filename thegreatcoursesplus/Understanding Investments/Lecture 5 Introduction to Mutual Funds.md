# Lecture 5: Introduction to Mutual Funds

First we learned stocks, then bonds, now Mutual funds.

**Mutual funds**: nothing more than pools of stocks, bonds, and other things

- on the surface, it doesn't look that great
- repackaging these assets take on new characteristics that are fundamentally different than the underlying assets
- the risk profile of the mf can be significantly different than the risk of the individual assets

- don't need as much money to purchase the wide variety of assets
- **economies of scale**
- make stock and bond investing more convenient and affordable

**Mutual funds are the best starter investments.**

- can be very successful just holding mutual funds

Mutual funds are just one of the many types of pooled investment funds (another: open-end mutual fund).

Started in 18th century. Made it to the U.S. in the late 19th century.

The modern mutual fund didn't take shape until the 1920's. It didn't come into its own until the 80's and 90's.

Defined Contribution Plans as opposed to the previous Defined Benefit Plans:

- IRA
- 401(k)
- 403(b)

In 1983, roughly 1/4 of Americans owned stocks. After year 2000, roughly half of all Americans owned stocks.

- this happened because of the switch from investment retirement funds to mutual funds

**Collective Investment Schemes** are called **Registered investment companies** by the SEC.

**Unit investment trust**: another CIS

- usually stocks and bonds stored in trusts: a legal vehicle for holding property on behalf of someone
- it splits up the big portfolio into small shares and sells them to the public as **redeemable trust certificates** (Units)
  - can sell back to trust at anytime
  - trust pays back the **Net Asset Value** (NAV): the market value of the portfolio that day, minus the liabilities of the fund, and divided equally
  - unit investment trusts held $50 billion out of \$13.1 trillion in total assets held in registered investment companies that year
- these are **static portfolios**
  - assets in the portfolio don't change

### Mutual funds

- mutual funds have dynamic portfolios where unit investment trusts do not
- **open-end fund**: always open to issuing new shares by selling to investors and always ready to redeem shares from investors
  - by far the most popular type of pooled investment
  - at end of 2010:
    - over 8500 mutual funds
    - held \$11.8 trillion
    - 1/4 of all U.S. corporate equity
    - 10% of bonds
  - an open-end mutual fund is an actual company with shareholders and a board of directors
  - it pays the Net Asset Value on the day it's sold (4pm ET)
  - mutual fund **sponsors**: Vanguard, Fidelity, Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch
    - you have to buy shares of the mutual fund through these institutions
  - mutual funds are required by the S.E.C. to have 85% of their investments in liquid assets which can be sold for the full value within 7 days
  - most mutual funds must hold securities from at least 12 different issuers: **diversification**
    - if they call themselves diversified, they cannot put over 5% in any one thing
  - also, restricted with leverage:
    - prohibited from borrowing unless they put aside 2-3 times as much in assets from what they borrow
    - they are permitted to hold derivatives
  - **Prospectus**: a document describing the objectives, operation, and risk of the mutual fund
    - the best source of information for prospective investor
    - **_it is crucial to read this as an investor_**
    - **Summary Prospectus**:
      - Investment Objectives
        - What the fund is trying to accomplish
      - Primary Investment Strategies
        - Detailed statement of how to achieve the investment objective
    - Also lists the **fees**, transaction costs
      - sales fees: **loads**
        - **Front-end load**
        - **Back-end load**:
          - redeeming shares
          - pays managers and encourages investors not to redeem
          - start high at 6% then decline by a percent a year
        - **No-load funds**: pay the Net Asset Value upon entering and leaving you receive the NAV
      - 12b-1 fees: costs for like advertising, printing the prospectuses
    - different classes of shares handle expenses differently
      - higher classes typically pay lower expenses
  - fund must display returns over the past 10 years
    - typically shown in 1, 5, and 10 year periods
  - **Active versus Passive** managed funds
    - Passive are called **index funds**: the benchmark returns are almost always based on some index
    - really how you view market efficiency
  - The companies on the S&P are determined by a committee
    - sell shares in the outgoing companies and buy shares in the incoming companies
- **closed-end fund**: only issue shares once and don't redeem shares unless the fund is liquidated
  - traded just like stocks, usually on exchanges
