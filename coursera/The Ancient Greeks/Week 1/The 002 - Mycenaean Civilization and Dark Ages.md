### The Mycenaean Civilization and Dark Ages

#### Video 1 - Mycenaean Civilization (ca. 1500 - 1150 BCE)

- The Minoan civilization has a troubled history
  - Peer Polity model
  - Re-distributive economy
- We will move from the island of Crete to the mainland, to a section called Mycenes
- The Mycenaeans wanted:
  - land that would be easy to defend
  - ample sources of fresh water
    - Mycenes had 2 springs

Mycenae:

- discovered by **Heinrich Schlieman (1822 - 1890)**
  - charismatic archaeologist forever linked with the site of Mycenes
  - made his fortune being an international businessman
  - knew a swath of languages
  - in middle age, he desired to become an archaelogist
  - he wanted to discover what Homeric reality would have been like
    - he wanted to discover the sites that would have been in the Illiad and the Odyssey
  - he first went to Troy
    - he found an enormous amount of treasure, King Priam's treasure
    - his wife wore some of the treasure
    - this was a spectacular hit
    - he became an international celebrity
  - then, he went to the ancient Bronze Age site of Mycenae
    - went to one of the great walls, the Lion's Gate, an entrance to one of these sites
    - allegedly, Schliemann said he was guided by the voice of Homer
    - the Lion's Gate was clearly built for defense
      - the stones are so large they are known as cyclopian since they were so large only a cyclops could lift and construct them
    - as he began his excavation of Mycanae, he discovered a grave circle
      - a number of distinct features
        - a number of upright tablets with writings and images
        - they were meant to mark graves
        - they were thought of as the boundary between the living and the dead
        - the people buried there left behind enormous quantities of gold, but no name
        - "The Mask of Agamemnon"
          - one of the gold masks that were placed on people who were buried
          - some people think Schliemann created and placed it. Our professor, Andrew Szegedy-Maszak, is not so convinced.
            - one scholar thinks it was discovered and cleaned up, or according to Arthur Evans, it was "reconstituted"
            - Schliemann's reputation to some people was between sketchy and nefarious
    - vast amounts of treasure and gold were buried with people
      - very important role in trade
      - personal adornments
    - Greece, at this time, was a very much part of a network of east Aegaen economies
      - it didn't look that different from places in the Middle East:
        - agricultural foundation
        - ruling elite
        - production of luxury goods that circulated among the ruling class, no matter where they lived in Greece or elsewhere
    - some time after the cyst graves, circles, the Mycenaeans constructed those enormous cyclopian walls and also began to treat their dead differently than before
      - They buried their dead in massive tombs, Tholos Tombs:
        - they are built into the side of a hill
        - have a long hallway (about 115 feet long for The Treasury of Atreus)
        - the interior has a beehive-shaped dome, some 38 feet high
        - it is estimated that the single piece of stone above the doorway weighs over 100 tons
          - massive amount of anonymous, conscripted labor
        - every time it seems that a burial was performed here, they had to dig out the tunnel from the previous burial
      - Tholos Tomb: "The Treasury of Atreus"
    - the picture we get of the social pyramid is a warrior-elite ruling class
      - they engaged in rivalry with other elites nearby
      - some kind of international trade with their class elsewhere
      - supported technology of gold and of literacy
        - like the Minoans, the Mycenaeans were literate
        - in the Proto-Greek that we call Linear B, here is a Mycenaean Linear B tablet
          - it is one of the little ironies that the flames that engulfed the Mycenaean citadels baked the tablets that were not meant to be preserved for a long time, they were temporary notations of store house contents
      - we also get pictures of social unrest or at least of high military preparedness
        - one of the most well-preserved artifacts is one of the bore-tusked helmets that Homer talked about soldiers having to protect their heads
- Mycenae civilization underwent a sudden, massive, systemic collapse. Between 1100 and 1150 BCE, in one citadel site after another, we find evidence of burning, pillaging, and destruction.
  - the inhabitants were killed or dispersed
  - their homes left for scavenging



Mycenaean history and artifacts show they were much more violent than the Minoans.
