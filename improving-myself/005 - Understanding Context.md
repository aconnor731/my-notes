## Understanding Context

If you only look at their body language, you won't have enough information to identify the source of their discomfort. Body language will tell you that someone is comfortable or uncomfortable, but it can't tell you why.

That's why you look at the context.

### What Is Context?

Looking at context means being aware of three things:

- **The conversation itself.**
  For instance, if your partner's language changed when you asked a specific question, perhaps there is something about that question that made them uncomfortable.
- **The environment the conversation takes place in.**
  Your partner might be reacting to something in your immediate surroundings. An argument at a nearby table, an overtly crowded room, or an ex-girlfriend who just entered the party could all be reasons why your partner suddenly became uncomfortable.
- **Your partner's recent experiences**.
  They might have had a bad day.

Try to remove the discomfort caused by the context, and see if your partner becomes comfortable.

And remember that if you can't deduce the source of their discomfort, it's usually ok to just ask them what's wrong. You don't need to be Sherlock Holmes; it's enough that you made an honest effort.

If you still don't know, still try to make them more comfortable. Offer to fix them their favorite drink, or pick a fun topic to talk about instead of a serious one. **It's preferable to know the specific source of their discomfort, but simply being aware that they are uncomfortable goes a long way.**

It will take some practice before you become comfortable with both looking at context and also focusing on the conversation, so don't be overwhelmed.

In a nutshell, the purpose of looking at context is to **find clues that help you make your partner more comfortable.**
