# Jesse Notes

Accept yourself before you can accept others, on a deep level

Express my feelings more than my needs

Avoid statements like:

- "I need to get over this"
- "I need to move on"
- "I need to be happy"

**Try to eliminate the word "need" for awhile"**

- I am grieving



Some things to say (liberating words instead of limiting words):

- "I choose to.." or "I plan to..."
- "It would be helpful to me if I..."

Avoid:

- "I should do this..."
- "I need to do this..."
