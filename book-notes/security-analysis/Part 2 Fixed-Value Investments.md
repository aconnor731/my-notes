# Part 2: Fixed-Value Investments

### Introduction to Part 2: Unshackling Bonds by Howard S. Marks

In 1965, the early days, common stock investors reference the  Dow Jones Industrial Average, not the S&P 500, and there was no talk of quartiles or deciles.

Hedge funds had not been invented yet.

The 1940 edition of *Security Analysis* marks an interesting turn toward what we would consider very modern thinking--it references some absolute standards but dismisses many others and reflects an advanced attitude toward sensible fixed income investing.

### Investment Absolutes

When Howard bean to manage high yield bonds in 1978, most institutional portfolios were governed by rules that limited bond holdings to either "investment grade" (triple B or better) or "A or better."

### Investment versus Speculation

Something occurred to him as he was re-reading the 1940 edition as Graham and Dodd were saying on thing and he was reading another: they didn't mean that something shouldn't be bought--**but rather that it shouldn't be bought, to use their phrase, "on an investment basis."**

**Securities qualified for investment on the basis of quality, not prospective return.**

A more modern attitude would be based on the notion that virtually any asset can be a good investment if bought knowledgeably and at a low-enough price. The opposite is also Howard sees as true: **there's no asset so good that it can't be a bad investment if bought too high a price.**

Everyone now realizes that membership on a list of "acceptable investments" certainly doesn't provide protection against loss. I.e., look at the bonds that were rated AAA a few decades ago or mortgage-backed securities that went from AAA to junk status in 2007.

A principle developed in *Security Analysis*: "a high coupon rate is not adequate compensation for the assumption of substantial risk of principal." (p. 125 on accompanying CD)

A more thorough reading, however, shows that securities that the authors say should not be purchased "on an investment basis" can still be considered "for speculation."

### Investment Realism

It is clear that Graham and Dodd are insistent on **substance over form**, and on **logic rather than rules**.

- it's how likely a bond is to pay that matters, not what it is labeled
- credit standards must not be fixed but instead must evolve
- safer bonds are not necessarily better buys than their juniors
- superior yield can render riskier issues more attractive
