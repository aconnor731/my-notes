## Week 6

#### 6.1: Introduction to the Homeric Hymns

- much more likely that they were written people that followed Homer
- from Greek word "Hymnos"
- individual hymns honor individual divinities
- we will focus on just two hymns: The Homeric hymn to Apollo and the Homeric hymn to Demeter
  - we will read the longer and extended versions
- they will give us insight to common themes in this type of writing
- they use the same meter
- temples are called out in hymns, this is pretty common in these hymns
- we talk directly to the god itself sometimes
- some narrative elements like goodbyes from the poet
- will see characteristic themes like getting to know the god
- first, the gods will be born: they don't just exist like some divinities
- they want to find some place on Earth they can call home
- they typically suffer pain or isolation to find these spots
- they will have certain claim over certain universal properties
- they have to find people to do things for them and worship them
- they really like being worshiped
- ritual background is very important

### 6.2: Ritual and Religion

- use "cult" to label ritual activity in honor of a god
- use the city as a way to have camaraderie
- time of the calendar
- festivals locations are notable
- common ritual activities:
  - purification
    - in a river, or any body of water
  - put on special clothing
  - processions
    - long march to some temple as a dedication
  - fasting
  - certain foods for these rituals
    - only eat/drink at certain times connected with ritual
  - sacrifice
    - bulls
    - larger the mammal, the better
    - prepare the animal, purification
    - decorate the animal
    - it is killed in honor of the divinity
    - carve up the meat and share to your people
    - thigh bones wrapped in fat go to the gods, the rich meat goes to the people
    - pigs, goats, poultry
    - not fish and neither other kinds of birds
    - non-animal sacrifice too, plants
    - common all around the Mediterranean world
- sacrifices are a demand from the gods
- sacrifices are a way of surrendering humans' own guilt
- killing the animal reinforces humans' own mortality with respect to the deathless gods they sacrifice to
- wine is an important part of the ritual, libations, and consumption
  - drunk in excess sometimes
  - typical in all ancient ritual that wine is a part of it, drunkenness is typical, but excessive drunkenness is idiosyncratic to Dionysus
- Games, theater, contests, etc.
  - long weekend festival to Athena
  - closing off ceremony would involve singing, a perfect place for a hymn

## 6.3: The Hymn to Demeter
