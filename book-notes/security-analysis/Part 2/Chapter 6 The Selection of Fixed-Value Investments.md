# Chapter 6: The Selection of Fixed-Value Investments

We have suggested a classification of securities by **character** rather than by **title**.

The already stated fixed-value group includes:

1. High-grade straight bonds and preferred stocks.
2. High-grade privileged issues, where the value of the privilege is too remote to count as a factor in selection.
3. Common stocks which through guaranty or preferred status occupy the position of a high-grade senior issue.

### Basic Attitude toward High-grade Preferred Stocks

The very definite inferiority of the preferred stockholders' legal claim is here left out of account, for the logical reason that the soundness of the best investments must rest not upon legal rights or remedies but upon ample financial capacity of the enterprise.

### Preferred Stocks Not Generally Equivalent to Bonds in Investment Merit.

We shall show in a later chapter that the *average* preferred issue deserves a lower rank than the average bond, and furthermore that preferred stocks have been much too readily accepted by the investing public.

The majority of these issues have not been sufficiently well protected to assure continuance of dividends *beyond any reasonable doubt*.

**They properly belong in the class of variable or speculative issues (<u>Group 2</u>)**.

It is only the exceptional preferred stock that deserves to rank as a fixed-value investment and to be viewed in the same light **as a good bond.**

### Is Bond Investment Logical?

The combination of a record high level for bonds (in 1940) with a history of two catastrophic price collapses in the preceding twenty years and a major war in progress is not one to justify airy confidence in the future.

### Bond Form Inherently Unattractive: Quantitative Assurance of Safety Essentials.

**A (straight) bond is an investment with *limited return*.**

Neither priority nor promise is itself an *assurance* of payment. This assurance rests in the **ability of the enterprise to fulfill its promise, and must be looked for in its financial position, record, and prospects.**

### Major Emphasis on Avoidance of Loss.

**Bond selection is a negative art and a process of exclusion and rejection, rather than of search and acceptance.**

**Broadly speaking, there is no such thing as being unduly captious or exacting in the purchase of fixed-value investments.**

"If there is a difficulty or a doubt the security should be declined." - Walter Bagehot addressing commercial bankers

### Four Principles for the Selection of Issues of the Fixed-value Type.

1. *Safety is measured not by specific lien (a right to keep possession of property belonging to another person until a debt owed by that person is discharged) or other contractual rights, but by the ability of the issuer to meet all of its obligations.*
2. *This ability should be measured under conditions of depression rather than prosperity.*
3. *Deficient safety cannot be compensated for by an abnormally high coupon rate.*
4. *The selection of all bonds for investment should be subject to rules of exclusion and to specific quantitative tests corresponding to those prescribed by statute to govern investments of savings banks.*

## 1. Safety Not Measured by Lien but by Ability to Pay

On the one hand the bond is regarded as a claim against *property*; on the other hand, as a claim against a *business.*

This can be reasonably expected to not hold up in times of depression for three reasons:

1. The shrinkage of property values when the business fails.
2. The difficulty of asserting the bondholders' supposed legal rights.
3. The delays and other disadvantages incident to a receivership.

### Lien is No Guarantee against Shrinkage of Values

### Impracticable to Enforce Basic Legal Rights of Lien Holder.

### Delays Are Wearisome.

### Basic Principle Is to Avoid Trouble.

### Corollaries from This First Principle.

3. *Senior Liens are to be favored, unless Junior obligations offer a substantial advantage.*

A junior lien of Company *X* may be selected in preference to a first-mortgage bond of Company *Y*, on one of two bases:

1. The protection for the total debt of Company *X* is adequate and the yield of the junior lien is substantially higher than that of the Company *Y* issue; or
2. If there is no substantial advantage in yield, then the indicated protection for the total debt of Company *X* must be considerably better than that of Company *Y*.

### Special Status of "Underlying Bonds."

**The ordinary investor may be well advised to leave such issues out of his calculations and stick to the rule that <u>only strong companies have strong bonds</u>.**
