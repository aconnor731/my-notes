# Lecture 9: A Master of Spectacle

- first, the Oresteia points to the importance of the **skene**
  - skene originally means "tent"
- eventually replaced by a permanent wooden structure
- **porphya**: purple color, or the color of blood
  - the tapestries from Libation Bearers are this color
  - Agamemnon would look like he is wading in a river of blood
- **ekkyklema**: in Greek, "rolled out thing"
  - may have been a simple wheeled trolley
  - may also have been a more elaborate revolving mechanism back into the skene
  - used to show scenes happening inside the skene building
- Clytamnaestra is standing over the bodies
- Apollo talks to Orestes and tells him to leave here and go to Athens
- the Furies are asleep, Clytamnaestra tries to awaken them, but they do not until she leaves
- hard to see that all 12 of the Furies fit inside the ekkyklema
  - she attends that 2 or 3 Furies were in the ekkyklema
- Aeschylus received pretty much a blank check to create this trilogy that resulted in a magnificent display and performance
