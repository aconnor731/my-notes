# Lecture 1: Rice Cookery

Rice is coming from the Po Plain in Italy, along the northern region

Pasta is definitely eaten by all people in Italy on Sundays, but if you were born and raised in northern Italy, you are more often eating rice or polenta on Sundays

We need to consider the size of the grain of the rice

Small grain rice is typical for risotto

Small grain rice:

- Starches (amylopectins) in the rice are higher than other grains
- Yield more liquid

Most grains: **1:1**

Risotto **3:1** (for every one cup of rice, 3 cups of liquid)

**_Risi e bisi_**: A slang name for this traditional Venetian dish, made from peas (*pisello*) and rice

- a little looser than a typical risotto
- ingredients:
  - green onions
    - anything on the bottom we don't want we cut off
    - Base:
      - aromatics
    - Middle:
      - mounting
      - for the puree
    - Top:
      - garnish

### Flavor Tip: The last thing you put in the cooking process if the first thing you taste and vice versa

If you cook chlorophyll above 265 degrees F it will break down much faster and turn black

Cooking the butter:

- you'll start to hear the water from the butter start to evaporate, signifying you are close
- keep the butter moving, the milk solids sink to the bottom and will brown if not in motion
-  

Cook Green onions for about 30 seconds once the butter is melted

Cook peas with movement to ensure they are coated

At a little bit of salt

Look at the edge of the pan to ensure it is at or above 212 degrees F (you can tell by if the water is evaporating since water evaporates at 212 degrees F)

Wait until the center of the pan is at the threshold of 265 degrees

Once it starts to boil in the center, turn off the heat.

Move into blender.

Once it is nice and smooth, set aside to chill.

Now to the **Ris e bisi**

Bring stock to a boil and add salt

**Arrotolata**:

- Rolled pancetta
- Sometimes called "ventreche" (rolled bacon) in French

**3 major rices from the Po Plain**:

- **Carnaroli**: medium grain
- **Arborio**
- **Vialone nano**

Traditionally, one espresso cup of raw rice per person. 

**Parching the rice**: Coating and toasting dry rice in oil

### Risotto Tip: Feel the rice with your hand to make sure it's hot

- once it hurts your hand, it is time to add the stock

Typically, in northern Italy, they don't use much olive oil, climate is too cold

Every region in Italy produces olive oil but two

**Ingredients**:

- Butter
- Peas
- Parmigiano-reggiano
- Salt Black pepper

### Risotto Tip: Make sure your rice is completely covered in liquid

Typically, four espresso cups of rice means adding 4 ladles of stock

Turn heat down to simmering temperature

**Simmering temperature**: 185-205 degrees F

Add a bit of salt and black pepper

Wait about 22 minutes until it's done, coming back in 18 minutes to check on it

If the rice becomes uncovered while cooking (probably due to too much heat), add more stock to cover it.

At the 18 minute mark:

- Check to make sure your rice is fully cooked with your thumb
  - when you press down, look how many pieces (amylopectins) there are
  - typically, if there are 4 or 5 pieces, it means you're about 4 to 5 minutes away from being completely cooked, which means now is time to add all our flavored ingredients: panchetta, peas, salt, black pepper and carefully mix

Now is time to add the **All'onda**: wave action used when finishing risotto

- stop stirring as it will break up the rice
- add the puree and parmesan cheese
- give gentle stir, then start the wave, flick it from the front to the back, this releases the starches from the rice

Once it has a soup-like gloss on it, it is time to plate

**Risotto is typically served on a plate**

Knock the bottom of the plate to get the risotto to relax and fall down.

Finish with grated parmesan cheese

Thus, completes our **Ris e bisi**
