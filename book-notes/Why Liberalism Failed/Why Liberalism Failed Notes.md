# Why Liberalism Failed Notes

Ideology in politics fails for two reasons:

1. Because it is based on falsehood about human nature, and hence can't help but fail.
2. Because as those falsehoods become more evident, the gap grows between what the ideology claims and the lived experience of human beings under its domain until the regime loses legitimacy.

Liberalism is burdened by the miseries of its success.

At its inception, liberalism promised to displace an old aristocracy in the name of liberty; yet as it eliminates every vestige of an old order, the heirs of their hopeful anti-aristocratic forebears regard its replacement as a new, perhaps even more pernicious, kind of aristocracy.

Liberalism was premised upon the limitation of government and the liberation of the individual from arbitrary political control.

Our government readily complies, moving like a ratchet wrench, always in one direction, enlarging and expanding in response to civic grievances, ironically leading in turn to citizens' further experience of distance and powerlessness.

The belief that liberalism could achieve *modus vivendi* by encouraging privatism has culminated in the nearly complete disassociation of the governing class and a citizenry without a *cives*.

### Economics

Whether people want the world "reaching into" individuals, corporations, and nation states is not a matter for discussion, for the process cannot be stopped.

Globalism is inevitable.

### Education

The rising generation is indoctrinated to embrace an economic and political system they distinctly fear, filling them with cynicism toward their future and their participation in maintaining an order they cannot avoid but which they neither believe in nor trust.

Far from feeling themselves to constitute the most liberated and autonomous generation in history, young adults believe less in their task at hand than Sisyphus rolling the boulder up the mountainside.

From a student of the author's: "We are meritocrats out of a survivalist instinct. If we do not race to the very top, the only remaining option is a bottomless pit of failure. To simply work hard and get decent grades doesn't cut it anymore if you believe there are only two options: the very top or rock bottom. It is a classic prisoner's dilemma: to sit around for 2-3 hours at the dining hall 'shooting the breeze', or to spend time engaged in intellectual conversation in moral and philosophical issues, or to go on a date all detract from time we could be spending on getting to the top and, thus, will leave us worse off relative to everyone else....Because we view humanity-and thus its institutions-as corrupt and selfish, the only person we can rely upon is our self. The only way we can avoid failure, being let down, and ultimately succumbing to the chaotic world around us, therefore, is to have the means (financial security) to rely only upon ourselves."

At the moment of liberalism's culmination, then, we see the headlong evacuation of the liberal arts. The liberal arts were long understood to be the essential form of education for a free people, especially citizens who aspired to self-government.

### Science and Technology

As the farmer and author Wendell Berry has written, if modern science and technology were conceived as a "war against nature," then "it is a war in every sense-nature is fighting us as much as we are fighting it. And...it appears that we are losing."

Today we are accustomed to arguing that we should follow the science in an issue such as climate change, ignoring that our crisis is the result of long-standing triumphs of science and technology in which "following science" was tantamount to civilizational progress.

Our carbon-saturated world is the hangover of a 150-year party in which, until the very end, we believed we had achieved the dream of liberation from nature's constraints.

**We still hold the incoherent view that science can liberate us from limits while solving the attendant consequences of that project.**

What is supposed to allow us to transform our world is instead transforming us, making us into creatures to which many, if not most of us, have not given our "consent."

**It is making us ever more into the creatures that liberalism supposed was our nature in that "state of nature" that existed before the coming of civilization, law, and government.**

Our main political choices come down to which depersonalized mechanism will purportedly advance our freedom and security-the space of the market, which collects our billions upon billions of choices to provide for our wants and needs without demanding from us any specific thought or intention about the wants and needs of others; or the liberal state, which establishes depersonalized procedures and mechanisms for the wants and needs of others that remain insufficiently addressed by the market.

Thus the insistent demand that we choose between protection of individual liberty and expansion of state activity masks the true relation between the state and market: that they grow constantly and necessarily together. 

**Statism enables individualism, individualism demands statism.**

The most challenging step we must take is a rejection of the belief that the ailments of liberal society can be fixed by realizing liberalism.

Both main political options of our age must be understood as different sides of the same counterfeit coin.

Liberalism's appeal lies in its continuities with the **deepest commitments of the Western political tradition, particularly efforts to secure liberty and human dignity through the constraint of tyranny, arbitrary rule, and oppression.**

A rejection of the world's first and last remaining ideology does not entail its replacement with a new and doubtless not very different ideology. Political revolution to overturn a revolutionary order would produce only disorder and misery. **A better course will consist in smaller, local forms of resistance: practices more than theories, the building of resilient new cultures against the anticulture of liberalism.**
