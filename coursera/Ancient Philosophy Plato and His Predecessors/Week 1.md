# Week 1

Characteristic of philosophy: **logos**

Can mean word, or speech, or argument, or account, or more generally, reason.

It is the root for the names of many scientific disciplines today: psychology, biology, cosmology, etc.

Other questions still remain within the domain of philosophy:

- ethics
- knowledge
- nature of reality

Two central figures: **Plato** and **Aristotle**

In the fresco, painting *School of Athens* by Raphael, Plato and Aristotle are in the center, with Plato on the left.

Plato: 430 - 347 BCE

Aristotle: 384 - 323 BCE

In the painting, one can see many of Plato's predecessors: Anaximander, Anaxagoras, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, and Plato's teachers, Socrates

Also, we see Aristotle's predecessors:

- cynic philosopher: Diogenes
- Zeno, the founder of Stoicism
- Epicurus, who founded the Epicurean school of philosophy
- even Plotinus, who was part of a revival of Platonism about 600 years after the birth of Plato.

Part 1 of the course, we will study Plato and his pre-Socratic predecessors.

Part two, we will study Aristotle, the Epicureans, and the Stoics.

## Part 1, Lecture 2: How we Study the Pre-Socrates

Pre-Socratic philosophers:

- Thales, 625 BCE
- Anaximander, 610 BCE
- Anaximenes, ?600 BCE
- Heraclitus, 540 BCE
- Parmenides, 515 BCE
- Anaxagoras, 500 BCE

We don't have any of the books they wrote

## Part 1, Lecture 3: Fragments and Sources

### Conventions for Understanding Pre-Socratic Philosophy

- information taken from later writers
- two types: **Fragments** and **Testimonia**
- Testimonia: paraphrases, summaries, reports, etc., marked with **A**
- Fragments: actual quotations, marked with the letter **B**
- An Example:
  "Listen not to me, but to the *logos*. It is wise to agree that all things are one." (*Heraclitus B50*)
  - B: actual quotation
  - 50: 50<sup>th</sup> fragment as printed in Diels-Kranz
- Thales:
  - none are actual quotations, and are all denoted with A
- DK 11A9:
  - 11: *Thales, Ch. 11 of DK*
  - A: Testimonia
  - 9: 9<sup>th</sup> in DK
- **the DK numbers are the standard way for citing pre-Socratic texts**
- these thinkers were considered by Aristotle as such:
  "Those who first pursued philosophy" - Aristotle (DK 11A12)

## Part 1, Lecture 4: Philosophers or Scientists?

- the First Philosophers, denoted by Aristotle: **Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes**
- they were Milesians, citizens of Miletus in Ionia, a Greek colony on the west coast of what is modern-day Turkey, in the 6<sup>th</sup> century
-
