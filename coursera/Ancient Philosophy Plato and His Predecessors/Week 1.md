# Week 1

Characteristic of philosophy: **logos**

Can mean word, or speech, or argument, or account, or more generally, reason.

It is the root for the names of many scientific disciplines today: psychology, biology, cosmology, etc.

Other questions still remain within the domain of philosophy:

- ethics
- knowledge
- nature of reality

Two central figures: **Plato** and **Aristotle**

In the fresco, painting *School of Athens* by Raphael, Plato and Aristotle are in the center, with Plato on the left.

Plato: 430 - 347 BCE

Aristotle: 384 - 323 BCE

In the painting, one can see many of Plato's predecessors: Anaximander, Anaxagoras, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, and Plato's teachers, Socrates

Also, we see Aristotle's predecessors:

- cynic philosopher: Diogenes
- Zeno, the founder of Stoicism
- Epicurus, who founded the Epicurean school of philosophy
- even Plotinus, who was part of a revival of Platonism about 600 years after the birth of Plato.

Part 1 of the course, we will study Plato and his pre-Socratic predecessors.

Part two, we will study Aristotle, the Epicureans, and the Stoics.
