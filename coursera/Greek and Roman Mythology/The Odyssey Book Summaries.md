# The Odyssey Book Summaries

## Book 1



## Book 2: Telemachus sets Sail

Athena encourages Telemachus to journey to Pylos to find Odysseus. Telemachus condemns the ruffians/suitors who are ravaging his household's wealth as they say they are all waiting to marry his widowed mother, Penelope. Telemachus agrees with Athena to go on this journey and Athena gathers a ship and a crew to prepare for the voyage.



## Book 3: King Nestor Remembers

Line 18: Athena says to Telemachus, "Telemachus, no more shyness, this is not the time!"

Telemachus arrives at King Nestor's magnificent coastal city of Pylios. Telemachus is awestruck from the grandeur at what he sees here. 9 groups of 500 people, each slaughtering 9 bulls. The opulence and display of wealth is extraordinary.

King Nestor of Pylios fought with King Odysseus at Troy.

- he does not know what happened to his father, Odysseus, because half of the forces at Troy stayed behind while the other half fled.

Orestes killed Aegisthus (his mother and Agamemnon's wife), who'd killed his famous father Agamemnon.

The book finishes with King Nestor's sons accompanying Telemachus on horseback across the landscape of Pylios towards his destination. Athena had left a few days before.

- also being schooled using historical lessons (you think you have it bad, look at this story of this person)
- they hint at taking action for himself

Aegisthus and her liason/lover conspired and killed King Agamemnon upon his return from Troy. Aegisthus has most of the responsibility of Agamemnon's death, according to Homer.



### Book 4: The King and Queen of Sparta

Telemachus visits the grandeur and nostalgia of Sparta to speak with King Menelaus and Helen.

The citadels in Sparta were truly magnificent. They thought only a cyclops could build these structures. The impulse to look at your ancestors as being greater begins to show here.

Helen brings in a bowl some wine mixed in with some narcotics she received in Egypt.

- she can bring you out of this world
- a magical and powerful aura
- Homer sees tremendous power of these qualities

Proteus of Egypt, the immortal Old Man of the Sea who never lies, who is Poseidon's servant.

Proteus explains to Menelaus that the nymph Calypso is holding Odysseus captive by force in her house. He has no way of returning home. No ship or crew.

Proteus says on line 640 that the gods count *him* the son-in-law of Zeus because he is Helen's husband.

The book finishes with some of the Achaean suitors/ruffians waiting in hiding with their ships inside a cove between Ithaca and Asteris to ambush and kill Telemachus. His mother, Icarius' daughter, Penelope, learns of this plot and is overwhelmed with sorrow and fear for her boy. Pallas Athena sends a spirit to comfort her where she tells her it is decreed that he will live.

### Book 5: Odysseus - Nymph and Shipwreck

Zeus sends Hermes to command the release of Odysseus from Calypso. Zeus decrees he shall not return to his native land on ship, but on a small raft.

Calypso helps him prepare for his voyage by providing him the choicest meats, wine, and water to accompany him. After 4 days, she sends him on his way. But Poseidon spots him and becomes angry at the site he sees. He conjures the most ravaging waves and storms to hinder Odysseus. These storms eventually crush his small raft upon which, another goddess of the sea who was once a mortal woman, Ino, takes pity on Odysseus and offers her aid. She tells him to leave the raft and swim to shore, Phaeacia, which is just on the horizon. She gives him her scarf that renders him impervious to any harm that may fall on him. Athena also counters Poseidon's curses.

Odysseus swims to shore but there are terrible reefs that impede his path. After much struggle, he spots the mouth of a river that is calm and would make a safe entry onto land.

After reaching the beach, he decides to go find shelter so that he may sleep. He lays beneath two olive bushes and closes his eyes at last.

### Book 6: The Princess and the Stranger



### Book 7: Phaeacia's Halls and Gardens

Nausicaa, the King's beautiful daughter.

Eurymedusa, the princess' chambermaid.

King Alcinous, the King of the Phaeacians

Queen Arete, wife of King Alcinous

Calypso, goddess on the island of Ogygia, daughter of Atlas

Calypso never won the heart of Odysseus, no matter how she tried.

Line 350: "Oh no my friend," (King) Alcinous stated flatly,
"I'm hardly a man for reckless, idle anger. Balance is best in all things."

The book ends with King Alcinous and Queen Arete giving him a place to sleep in their noble halls after promising Odysseus a safe and swift voyage home, providing him the materials to do so.



### Book 8: A Day for Songs and Contests

Line 170: King Alcinous' son, Laodamas, challenges Odysseus to games of sport:

"Come, stranger, sir, won't you try your hand at our contests now? If you have skill in any. It's fit and proper for you to know your sports. What greater glory attends a man, while he's alive, than what he wins with his racing feet and striving hands?..."

Line 200: Odysseus responds after he replies that he would not like to join in the games:

"...You, you're a reckless fool - I see *that*. So, the gods don't hand out all their gifts at once, not build and brains and flowing speech to all. One man may fail to impress us with his looks but a god can crown his words with beauty, charm, and men look on with delight when he speaks out. Never faltering, filled with winning self-control, he shines forth at assembly grounds and people gaze at him like a god when he walks through the streets. Another man may look like a deathless one on high but there's not a bit of grace to crown his words. Just like you, my fine, handsome friend. Not even a god could improve those lovely looks of yours but the mind inside is worthless. Your slander fans the anger in my heart..."

Odysseus is challenged to games by Laodamas, recklessly choosing his words that fanned Odysseus' anger. Odysseus then accepts his challenge and throws a discus much farther than all the other "young pups." King Alcinous then graciously asks for Odysseus to join in some dancing, or at least watch. The boys in the flush of youth were skilled dancers and left Odysseus' heart aglow with wonder.

King Alcinous has his fellow twelve peers each give Odysseus a fresh cloak and shirt and a bar of precious gold before sending him on his return voyage home.

Line 520: Odysseus bids farewell to the beautiful Nausicaa: "Nausicaa, daughter of generous King Alcinous, may Zeus the Thunderer, Hera's husband, grant it so - that I travel home and see the dawn of my return. Even at home I'll pray to you as a deathless goddess all my days to come. You saved my life, dear girl."

Line 530: Odysseus says, "...From all who walk the earth our bards deserve esteem and awe, for the Muse herself has taught them paths of song. She loves the breed of harpers."

Line 600: King Alcinous says, "...Treat your guest and suppliant like a brother: anyone with a touch of sense knows that."

The book ends with King Alcinous asking Odysseus to tell them about his life, where he is from, and why he weeps when the bard sings of the battle at Troy.

### Book 9: In the One-Eyed Giant's Cave
