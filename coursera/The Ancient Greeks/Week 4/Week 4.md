## Week 4 / Lecture 1: The End of Athenian Tyranny and the Democratic Revolution

- Pisistratus was such a good ruler that Aristotle had to give him his own category
  - Aristotle established him as "half-bad" as he was a tyrant but generally a good tyrant
- Pisistratus died in 528
- His two sons ruled after him: Hipparchus and Hippias
  - at least initially, this tandem rule seemed to have succeeded
  - then things went bad
- Harmodius and Aristogeiton killed the tyrant Hipparchus at a festival in 514 BCE
  - this becomes famous as the tyrannicide
- Thucydides thought this came from a personal insult
  - Harmodius rejected Hipparchus' advances
  - Hipparchus forbayed Harmodius sister from participating in the procession, suggesting she was not a virgin
- tyranny does not end after Hipparchus is killed
- both Harmodius and Aristogeiton were killed
- Hippias was much more strict and paranoid
- In 511, he was expelled
- Spartan king Kleomenes and helped an Athenian politician Isagoras, and Kleomenes manages to capture some of Hippias' family, leveraging him to leave Athens
- The Athenian Revolution [J. Ober]

1. Isagoras & Kleomenes attempt to dissolve the Boule
2. The Boule resists
3. Kleomenes and Isagoras occupy the Acropolis, with Spartan help
4. The rest of the Athenians unite. [Aristotle: "The crowd gathered itself together."]
5. They besiege the Spartan occupiers
6. Kleomenes surrenders on the 3rd day of the siege, and the Spartans withdraw.



**Important theme: without a leader, a people overthrow to establish a democracy.**
