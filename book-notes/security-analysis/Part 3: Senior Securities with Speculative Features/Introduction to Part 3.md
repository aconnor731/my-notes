# Introduction to Part 3: "Blood and Judgement" by J. Ezra Merkin

If the names of Graham and Dodd are a talisman for value investors, they are practically a sacrament for those who focus on **bankrupt companies.**

Bankruptcy, or distressed investing, is perhaps the purest form of value investing.

**Distressed investing is a form of value investing at a substantial discount.**

It will become apparent that distressed investing is a classic Graham and Dodd discipline.

The authors caution that "bonds should be bought on a depression basis" because an investment cannot be sound unless it can withstand true adversity. (p. 154)

It is easy to get caught up with the crowd when the market is booming, harder to think about what securities are really worth.

It is not easy to stay on the sidelines while others are busy getting rich.

Whether a security is a good buy or not is a function of its price relative to its value.

Distressed investors have the idea that is to find valuable assets or inherently profitable companies that have nonetheless leveraged themselves up to **levels of debt unsustainable by their cash flows.**

**Graham and Dodd's margin of safety sends investors to scrutinize the balance sheet and projected earnings.**

- for them, the balance sheet is the main thing, far more than earnings, if for no other reason than necessity, as most bankrupt companies no longer have earnings.

The authors prize stocks that sell below their current asset, or liquidating, value.

## The Varieties of Bankruptcy

2 types of bankruptcies, which are, in effect, three:

1. *liquidations*
   1. the purest Grahamd and Dodd exercise of all, as the investor buys a security to create a workout that is entirely (or nearly entirely) cash.
2. *reorganizations*: two flavors:
   1. those producing a melane of cash and securities
   2. those in which the investor's goal is control of the reorganized company

It is not the nature of a distressed investment to realize its goals in the blink of an eye or even in the turn of a quarter or two.

In effect, the bankruptcy investor acts as the incubator, buying tad-poles and selling frogs.

Examples suggest that, while individual investors may have success picking stocks, it is far more difficult for them to partake in distressed investing.

### Liquidations

#### Texaco: A Quasi-bankruptcy

In the standard liquidation, senior creditors are paid off as best as the company's assets will allow; sometimes, unsecured creditors are fortunate enough to receive a meaningful distribution too.

Distressed investing generally involves buying debt instruments of a troubled company, because in most bankruptcies the equity is wiped out.

Texaco's unusual situation can be summarized in one sentence, often repeated by Graham and Dodd disciple Warren Buffett: **A great investment opportunity occurs when a marvelous business encounters a onetime huge, but solvable, problem.**

Here was a bankruptcy in which the equity was not wiped out--and no one expected it to be wiped out.

### Grab Bag Reorganizations

In Graham and Dodd's terminology, we move away from investment toward speculation when we shift focus from liquidations to reorganizations that include cash plus a bag of securities.

#### Adelphia Communications

Because companies often issue different classes of debt, bankruptcy litigation commonly involves a battle among the different classes of creditors.

Adelphia, founded in 1952 by Rigas, was a cable company.

At one point, Adelphia's debt reached 11 times its market capitalization.

Eventually, Adelphia filed for Chapter 11, and, in August 2007, Rigas went to federal prison for conspiracy, securities fraud, and bank fraud.

Those who bought Century bonds (a large subsidiary of Adelphia) at the bottom and held them through a contentious and protracted legal process enjoyed a return of over 400%.

#### Winn-Dixie Stores

#### Bradlees

At the conclusion of a grab bag reorganization, creditors may find themselves in a very different position from the one they occupied at the outset. As Graham and Dodd note, voting control over the corporation can pass in bankruptcy to the bondholders, who will then become equity holders in the new entity that enjoys a statutory fresh start. (p. 238)

### Reorganization as Avenue to Control

This is approaching speculation rather than investing, according to the authors.

#### Guinness Peat Aviation

The authors think investors should avoid low grade bonds together with common stocks.

#### MCI WorldCom

### Distressed Investing

**Graham and Dodd rejected the Efficient Market Hypothesis and analogized the market to a *voting machine*, producing results that are the product partly of reason and partly of emotion, rather than an exact and impersonal *weighing machine*.**

If the market gets the "correct" price "wrong" in ordinary investing, such error occurs even more frequently in distressed investing.

As implied by the very name *distressed investing*, purchasers of distressed securities search for bargains made available by the unhappiness of sellers who bought those securities in happier times.

Thus, when a company experiences distress, there are many forced sellers clamoring for the narrow exit doors, and there are not enough buyers to widen the door and hold up the "correct" price.

**Wall Street is not consistent of bulls and bears but rather sharks, constantly shifting direction in an eternal search for food.**

**"Bull markets are born in pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria." - Sir John Templeton**

Euphoria in Wall Street's debt-creation machine leads to a crash, and that is when the bankruptcy investor supplies fresh equity and retires debt, frequently at a discount.

### The Risk Insight

"Security prices and yields are not determined by any exact mathematical calculation of the expected risk, but they depend rather upon the *popularity* of the issue" (p. 164).

"If we assume that a fairly large proportion of a group of carefully selected low-priced bonds will escape default, the income received on the group as a whole over a period of time will undoubtedly far exceed the dividend return on similarly priced common stocks." (p. 327)

"This is the nature of the financial service business. You go into a steady decline, and then you fall off a cliff." - Jeffrey Lane, former president of Shearson Lehman Hutton

"When you have the ideas, you can't get the money; when you can get the money, you don't have the ideas." - Leon Levy

## First Principles and Paradigm Shifts

As long as investors remain human, and thus subject to greed, fear, pressure, doubt, and the entire range of human emotions, there will be money to be made by those who steel themselves to overcome emotion.

As long as the human tendency to march in herds persists, there will be opportunities for contrarians who are unafraid to stand alone.

**Think of Graham and Dodd as embodying the spirit of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who declared: "Blest are those/Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,/That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger/To sound what stop she please."**
