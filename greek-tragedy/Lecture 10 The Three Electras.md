# Lecture 10: The Three Electras

- Sophocles and Euripides each wrote a play called Electra, about Orestes vengeance on his mother Clytamnaestra
- will use Aeschylus' story of Orestes in Libation Bearers as a touchstone for the plays by Sophocles and Euripides
- in Libation Bearers, stress is on the son, Orestes, torn between two irreconcilable duties to his father and his mother
- in both plays by the other tragedians is focused on Electra, not Orestes
  - focused on her reactions as opposed to Orestes'
- Euripides' *Electra*: 415 - 413? B.C.
- have no clues to date Sophocles' *Electra*
- Freud chose to name the female equivalent of the Oedipus complex the Electra complex based on Sophocles' Electra
- Orestes and his friend/servant Piletes arrive at Clytamnaestra's palace, the old servant, as opposed to Aeschylus' version with Orestes stating, falsely stating Orestes' death in a chariot race to gain entrance to the palace
- we first see Electra when she laments the death of her own father and her own wasted life, too old to bear children, her life is empty apart from her vengeance for her mother
- her sister, Chrisothomus, invented by Sophocles
- when they learn of Orestes' death, they are emboldened towards vengeance even more
- Electra sings a long  song of lament while holding the urn containing Orestes' body, **her last hope for her family**
  - the audience knows the urn is empty, very powerful as a metaphor for the empty life Electra has led
- Orestes pities his sister's sorrow and identifies himself
- they have a briefly joyful reunion
- Orestes' servant warns them the time is now to kill Clytamnaestra
- Orestes goes inside, leaving Electra outside with the chorus
- here, we here Clytamnaestra crying out
- the more horrifying note: Electra urges her brother to keep stabbing to kill Clytamnaestra
- Piletes and Orestes return from the skene and Orestes says "all is well if Apollo was right"
- Agesthis returns and wants to see the dead body of Orestes
- a shrouded body is shown and Agesthis is taken inside to be killed on the same spot of Agamemnon's murder
- **important difference to Aeschylus' play, there is no mention of the Furies**
  - also, Agesthes is murdered first in the other two plays before Clytamnaestra's death
- Sophocles' version leaves us with a sense of a lack of fulfillment, a lot is left uncertain
