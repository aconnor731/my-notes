# Lecture 3: Starting with Stocks

Essentials:

- Stocks



Stocks are the best place to learn about investing, not necessarily the first securities you should buy.

**Stock Investing**:

- Clear and easy to understand
- Same ideas behind all investing
- Simple contract
- Similar to other investing

Stocks are a good model for other investments.

How do companies raise cash to purchase another company?

- they sell financial assets, with an agreement/promise to pay cash at a later date
- they also sell ownership stake (stock)
- each share has an equal claim on the profits

**Good companies to invest in invest in successful projects.**

In reality, companies don't fund their projects through selling shares.

- IPO, is the initial way to raise money
- usually, there are cheaper ways for a company to raise money
- usually, when a company buys another company, it issues shares to do this

**Most investors buy their stock from other investors, not directly from firms.**

**Primary market**: market for new assets that investors buy directly from the borrowers who issue them.

- IPO's

**Secondary market**: used, or preowned assets

- when investors sell to each other

- taking over the loan from someone else

**Control**:

- Shareholders elect a Board of Directors, who hires a Professional Management Team that consists of a CEO, Managers, and Workers

Activist investors: purchase large portions of stock in poorly performing companies and then pressure the managers to change the way they run their business.

- Bill Ackman, Carl Icahn

**Dividends**: profits the company pays out to its shareholders

- companies have no obligation to meet this
- company can pay out to shareholders, or re-invest in future projects
- Microsoft did this:
  - it didn't pay out to investors, and people kept buying its product
  - in 2003, it pays a dividend and has ever since (enough profits and they didn't have enough investments to spend them on)

**Trading is an essential part of investing in stocks**

- this is due to the fact that companies rarely issue shares directly to investors

**Depositories**: official storage facilities of securities these days

**Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)**

- ensures the brokers do not illegally tamper with your securities

**Dealer**: you sell directly to him/her, they are then responsible for selling it

**Stock exchange**: an organized market where people can meet and trade shares

- you have to be a member
- to be a member, you have to pay a large fee

**Lot size**: standard quantities called lots

- a dozen eggs
- a sheet of paper

- Round lot: 100 shares
  - fastest trades at multiples of 100 shares

**Orders**:

- Market order: buy or sell at whatever the current price is
  - downside: prices can move so quickly that they don't buy at the price they thought
- Limit order: places an upper or lower limit price on an order
  - limit order book: shows the demand and supply curves for shares
  - **cost more than market orders**
- Stop-loss order: sell shares once the price of the shares falls below a certain level
