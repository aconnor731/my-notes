# Chapter 17: Guaranteed Securities

## Guaranteed Real Estate Mortgages and Mortgage Bonds

The practice of guaranteeing securities reached its widest development in the field of real estate mortgages.

### This Business Once Conservatively Managed.

In period prior to 1924, mortgages were guaranteed much more conservatively and lax thereafter.

**The amount of each mortgage was limited to not more than 60% of the value, carefully determined; large individual mortgages were avoided; and a fair diversification of risk, from the standpoint of location, was attained.**

Also, maturing obligations of say 3 to 5 years after issuance meant they fell at a most inconvenient time.

Nevertheless, the prudent conduct of their activities had enabled them successfully to weather severe real estate depressions such as occurred in 1908 and 1921.

### New and Less Conservative Practices Developed.

Great emphasis was laid upon the long record of success in the past, and the public was duly impressed--not realizing that the size, the methods, and the personnel were so changed that they were in fact dealing with a different institution.

The financing methods were recklessly unsound for real estate ventures during this period.

### Evil Effects of Competition and Contagion.

The face amount of the mortgages guaranteed rose to so high a multiple of the capital of the guarantor companies that it should have been obvious that the guaranty would afford only the flimsiest of protection in the event of a general decline in values.

When the real estate market broke in 1931, the first consequence was the utter collapse of virtually every one of the newer real estate bond companies and their subsidiary guarantor concerns.

Apparently only a very small fraction of the mortgages outstanding in 1932 were created under the conservative conditions and principles that had ruled up to, say, eight years previously.

### Guarantees by Independent Surety Companies.

They did so for a fee or premium.

In most cases the resultant losses to the guarantor were greater than it could stand; several of the companies were forced into receivership (notably National Surety Company), and holders of bonds with such guarantees failed to obtain full protection.

## Leasehold Obligations Equivalent to Guarantees

The property of one company is often leased to another for a fixed annual rental sufficient to pay interest and dividends on the former's capital issues.

### Specific Terms of Lease Important.

### Guaranteed Issues Frequently Undervalued.

## Inclusion of Guarantees and Rentals in the Calculation of Fixed Charges

All obligations equivalent to bond interest should be included with a company's interest charges when calculating the coverage for its bond issues.

### Lease Liabilities Generally Overlooked.

The question of liability under long-term leases received very little attention from the financial world until its significance was brought home rudely in 1931 and 1932, when the high level of rentals assumed in the preceding boom years proved intolerably burdensome to many merchandising companies.

### Such Liabilities Complicated Analysis.

Fortunately the investor now has some data as to the extent of such leasehold obligations, since they are now required to be summarized in registration statements filed with the S.E.C, and the actual rent payments must be stated each year (on Form 10-K).

One type of solution is obvious: If the company meets the earnings test, even after adding rents paid to bond interest, the rent situation need not worry the investor.

We feel, however, that it would be neither fair nor practicable to require every company to meet a test so severe.

A compromise suggestion based on some study of actual exhibits may be hazarded, *viz.:* **(1) that one-third the annual rentals (for building space) be included with fixed charges (and preferred dividends), to compute the earnings coverage; and (2) that in the case of retail establishments (chain stores, department stores) the minimum coverage required for interest plus one-third of rentals be reduced from 3 to 2.**

### Status of Guaranteed Obligations.

## Subsidiary Company Bonds

The bonds of a subsidiary of a strong company are generally regarded as well protected, on the theory that the parent company will take care of all its constituents' obligations.

### Separate Analysis of Subsidiary Interest Coverage Essential.

A subsidiary bond should not be purchased on the basis of the showing of its parent company, unless the latter has assumed direct responsibility for the bond in question.

Investors in bonds of a *holding company* must insist upon a consolidated income account, in which the subsidiary interest--whether guaranteed or not--is shown as a prior charge; but that purchasers of unguaranteed *subsidiary* bonds cannot accept such consolidated reports as a measure of their safety, and must require a statement covering the subsidiary alone.
