## The Secret of Conversation Flow

**Conversation flow** happens when conversation is comfortable, effortless and smooth. It is the way conversations are supposed to work.

What do you do when conversations don't flow? That's where the principle of **invitation and inspiration** comes in. They are the key ingredients of smooth, comfortable conversation.

- An **invitation** is when you say something that explicitly lets your partner know it is their turn to speak.
- An **inspiration** is when you say something that makes your partner want to speak unbidden.

Here's how it works:

**The Deli Metaphor**

Imagine your partner and yourself are working at a deli shop and are working together to make a sandwich with each of you at opposite ends of the counter. You each pass the sandwich to the other after adding something.

You ask, "How was your weekend?" and slide the sandwich down the counter.

Your partner replies, "Oh, it was great. How was yours?" and slides the sandwich back.

You reply "It was fine." and try to return the sandwich but it travels six inches and stops dead.

What happened? You didn't give your partner a clear **invitation** or a strong **inspiration**. Without either of those things, your partner didn't know what to say next (and perhaps was unsure if it was his turn to speak) so he didn't respond.

You want to be deliberate to offer invitations and inspirations to your partner.

### Invitation: The Art of Good Questions

An **invitation** is something you say that:

- communicates very clearly that it is now your partner's turn to talk,

  and

- gives a strong suggestion for what your partner should talk about.

For instance, "What did you do today?" is an invitation.

Most invitations are questions, but not all questions are good invitations.

For a question to be a good invitation, **it needs to satisfy the first two rules I listed above, and it also needs to be open-ended.**

#### The Power of Good Questions

"Open-end question": an invitation that allows your partner to talk at length, instead of being limited to a short answer.

This: "What did you do this weekend?"

Not this: "Did you have a good weekend?"

Not only does inviting your partner to share help the conversation to flow, but it also gives you an opportunity to show your partner that **you are interested in them**.

The classic writing rule of "Show, don't tell" applies to conversation, too.

#### How to Ask Good Questions

There is an art to asking good, insightful questions.

Don't ask questions that are too superficial nor too intimate.

The trick is to **start superficial, and then slowly go more intimate while keeping an eye on the other person's <u>comfort</u> level.**

If you don't know the person that well, don't go too intimate. Over time as you get to know them, you can ask more intimate questions.

Also, if you ask the other person more intimate questions, you should share more intimate things about yourself. If you don't open to them after they have opened up to you, they will quickly become uncomfortable.

However, as handy as invitations are, you can't build an entire conversation out of them. That is where inspirations come in.

### Inspiration in Practice

When you want to inspire your partner, be deliberate to share something that might inspire them to share their **curiosity**, their **thoughts**, or their **story**.

- these are not the only ways to inspire your partner--anything that encourages your partner to share is an inspiration.
