# Lecture 10: Richard II: History and Kingship

**How important is English history to Shakespeare's history?**

- You have to have at least a nodding advance
  - **a basic understanding of history**
- Shakespeare does play fast and loose with history

War of the Roses: between houses Lancaster and York

Shakespeare's first monarch: Queen Elizabeth II

Shakespeare second monarch: James I

- handed kingdom to son Charles, be deposed and executed in 1649 by the Puritan revolution led by Oliver Cromwell

Not until the end of the 17th century would the monarchy be stable.

**Kingdom is Shakespeare's time was very unstable**

His history plays treat the stories involving the kings, queens, and rebels that lead right up to Queen Elizabeth II.

Remember the tool: **Start with a scene**

Setting:

- Flint castle at the border between Wales and England
- armament is waiting for the keeper
- then Richard II comes out, and the army is against him, like a civil war

**Crucial Tool: Kingship**

- how these plays put kingship into question
- reveals Shakespeare's attitude towards kingship and history itself and its meanings

Important sentiment of Shakespeare's king James I that kingship is divinely ordained: **the divine right of God**.

- only God can take away his power
- "Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
  Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
  That life your vassal hands against
    my head
  And threat the glory of my precious crown."
  (Act III, Scene 3)

James I: To dispute with the king is blasphemy.

Shakespeare seems to be supporting this conservative political opinion.

The army, is led by Richard's cousin, Henry, and has come back to reclaim his family lands.

Richard is a bad leader:

- taxes unfairly
- seizes other nobles' like Henry, land
- can't stop knights from squabbling

Richard's ruinous economic policies have rotted the land.

**Does it flourish, or does it perish under the monarch's rule?**

- Richard's rule is ruinous

Henry Bolingbroke is a competent leader.

- he knows when to be purposely ambiguous
  - he originally says he comes to reclaim his land, but is actually going for the crown itself
- gives swift decisions

Richard just rolls over and submits to Henry.

Shortly after, Henry speaks to the public about claiming the throne.

**Does worth or birth make the king?**

- the sentiment shows monarchy's legitimacy waning

**Tool: Drama of ideas: Shakespeare's plays contemplate religion, philosophy, history, and politics.**

Does God even care about human affairs? Is God even there?

**Tool: Understanding history**

- how do these plays compare with his comedies and tragedies
- he starts with strictly English kings
- wrote 8 major history plays, strictly English ranging 1377 to 1485, starting with Richard II
- two groups:
  - First Henriad, first tetralogy
    - first four plays written
    - chronologically follow the second Henriad
    - consists of:
      - **Henry VI**
        - **Part 1**
        - **Part 2**
        - **Part 3**
      - **Richard III**
  - Second Henriad, second tetralogy
    - written 7-10 years after the first
    - greater literary achievement by far
    - consists of:
      - **Richard II** (significant step forward in his art)
      - **Henry IV** (major importance)
        - **Part 1**
        - **Part 2**
      - **Henry V** (iconic status of Shakespeare's ideal Christian king, but much more elaborate than that)

8 main history plays

- refined and evolved over time

If broad number of historical characters: probably First Henriad

Focused, following the hero framework: probably Second Henriad

~1595, character-driven dramas with compelling personage:

- Juliet
- Richard II
- Shylock
- Henry 5
- Rosalind
- Julius Caesar
- Hamlet himself

Shakespeare's greatest reference for historical material: *The Chronicle of England, Scotland, and Ireland* by Raphael Holinshed, 1577 & 1587, first and second editions respectively

- also for MacBeth, King Lear

Remember the **tool: Play within the play**

- deposing King Richard
- but Richard is more poetic, that do not paint Henry in a good light
- Richard shows he is the victim

Later, King Lear will show the gulf between the office of the King and the man.

**Crucial tool: Cain and Abel dynamic: conflict between brothers**: (Richard and Henry, even though they are cousins, not brothers)

- biblical story: Cain murders his brother Abel

**Tools recap:**

- **Understanding history**
- **Kingship**
- **Drama of ideas**
- **Cain and Abel dynamic**
  - the fundamental, almost biblical, conflict at the root of history, politics, and even as it seems, human culture
