# Lecture 8: Twelfth Night: More Comic Tools

In this play, there's no forest, no green world, no enchantment, no fairy queen. Instead, it's as if confusion of identity is somehow written into the very characters--they can't help but get confused about who and what they are.

**Confusion of identity is a crucial determinant of tragedy and comedy.**

**Major tool: to watch for, and try to sort out, the crisis of identity within the play.**

**These tools can be transferred to other plays with great effect.**

Early versus mature comedies:

- In *Dream*, there is an angry father who blocks young love
  - In *Twelfth Night*, the father is entirely absent (died years before)
    - Viola is, we might think , completely free to love whom and where she chooses--but she does not.

Viola, for reasons that are unclear, decides to disguise herself as a young man and offer her skills in service to the local Duke, upon whose shores she has been cast up. She falls in love with the Duke but cannot reveal her true identity.

- **the block to love is internal**

Shakespeare seems to be revealing a fundamental human truth: that our self-mistrust brings about a block to our ability to love every bit as profound and powerful as if a real person were standing between us and the object of our love.

- this is common in the mature comedies, just as it is in the great tragedies
- the crisis each character in this play faces is to know oneself--to know one's interior, true self.
- each character is in a state of excess, of a false existence, caused by not knowing their true, interior desires.

Orsino believes he is head over heels in love with Countess Olivia, but he is actually in love with the idea of himself as a lover.

- he wants to be in love:

  "If music be the food of love, play on,
  Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
  The appetite may sicken, and so die."

- he hopes that if he feeds on love, he will grow sick of love, and his desire for Olivia will go away. Of course the opposite happens.
- he is like Romeo in Act 1: a man who is a victim of infatuation and his own self-pitying suffering.

Olivia, is also in a state of passivity. She will mourn and abjure the society of men for seven years because her beloved brother has recently died.

- Orsino turns this into a capacity to love him
- Instead of going to woo her, he goes off to recline:
  "Away before me to sweet beds of flows! / Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers."

Clowns are often the voice of wisdom in Shakespeare's plays.

- Feste's words are intended to instruct rather than chastise
- He helps Olivia move from Freud's thanatos (death drive) to eros (life drive)
  - **This is a good way to understand the entire energy of Shakespearean comedy**

**The most fundamental tool for all of Shakespeare's plays: Distinguish the external appearance from the internal reality.**

Low plot of the play: between knights of Sir Toby Belch and Sir Andrew Aguecheek

- their names suggest who they really are: Toby and drunkard and merry fellow, Andrew a born follower, sickly and gullible

Sir Toby only keeps Sir Andrew around because of his money.

- Toby tricks him into paying for the parties by pretending that his niece, Olivia, will fall in love with him if he keeps wooing her.
  - this mirrors the more elevated plot of Olivia, Orsino, and Viola

Malvolio mirrors others in the play, but with a negative difference:

- repressed like Olivia, but unlike her, wants to extend his repression to others and deny them all pleasures
- narcissistic like Orsino, but unlike Orsino, he wants his self-love to come at the expense of others
- he is the classic killjoy
  - opposed to possibilities of self-transformation (which is what all of Shakespeare's plays are really about)
- he hates Feste
- he hates Toby and Andrew and their revelry

**Important tool: We must observe how the opponent of mirth will be punished.**

Malvolio tries to have Toby thrown from the house so Toby, Andrew, and Maria have conspired to get their revenge.

- they will take the high plot and apply it not to heal someone, but in fact to punish.
- they will make him do all sorts of ridiculous things for Olivia as they trick him into believing she is in love with him
- **this whole subplot depends on the magnificent letter scene**
  - Maria actually wrote the letter, not Olivia

We see how close it is to tragedy.

What's remarkable about *Twelfth Night* is that the high plot and the low plot mirror one another, but at the same time, the two plots go in opposite directions--which is a quality that is often found in the mature comedies.

Antonio, a sailor, befriends Viola's brother Sebastian. It might be homoerotic love.

Antonio is left alone at the end of the play since Olivia ends up with Sebastian and Orsino with Viola.

- he does not have a happy ending
- **he is a sacrifice figure**, a person who is left outside of the happy ending even as he helps it happen
  - **Tool: we must watch how these figures function and ask why they are excluded from the happiness at the end of the comedy and what is gained by their sacrifice.**
  - also true in *As You Like It* and *The Merchant of Venice*

Malvolio prides himself on his restraint, but Feste points out to him that this restraint is really repression.

**Shakespeare realizes in his mature comedies that no matter how redemptive and life generating the comic vision is, there is also a dark undercurrent at work that shows that we laugh at others in order to keep the laughter and the isolation from turning upon ourselves.**

Feste speaks to Malvolio at the end reminding his chastisement was recompense for his negative demeanor:
"And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges." Time will bring about a rough justice, and the cruelty we visit upon others will ultimately be visited back upon ourselves.

**Viola is a key figure as she is a boundary-crossing figure: a key tool in Shakespeare's plays.**

- like Puck from *Dream*, she can speak with everyone
- she teaches who the characters really are and what they want

Each character is in a state of excess:

- Orsino's excess of self-love
- Olivia's excess of mourning
- Toby's excess of mirth
- Malvolio's excess of vanity

Part of Viola's role is to curb that excess and bring each character into a state of self-knowledge and harmony.

Often, the disguised woman can somehow be everything to all people.

She cuts through appearance and gets at the true reality.

**She is also a figure of grace: another tool**

- she opens Olivia to the possibilities of love and accomplishes the same thing with Orsino

The plot is able to work itself out only because of Viola

**Favorite lines**:

"How easy is it for the proper false (*Handsome, but deceitful (men)*)
In women's waxen hears to set their forms. (*To impress their images on women's affections (as a seal stamps its image in wax)*)" - Act 2, Scene 2, line 28-29
