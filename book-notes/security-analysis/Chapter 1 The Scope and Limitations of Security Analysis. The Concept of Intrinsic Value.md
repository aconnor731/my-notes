# Chapter 1: The Scope and Limitations of Security Analysis. The Concept of Intrinsic Value

Investment, by nature, is not an exact science.

## Three Functions of Analysis:

Three headings: **descriptive**, **selective**, and **critical**

### 1. Descriptive Function

**Descriptive analysis**: marshalling the important facts relating to an issue and presenting them in a coherent, readily intelligible manner.

### 2. The Selective Function of Security Analysis

In its selective function, security analysis goes further and expresses specific judgments of its own.

It seeks to determine whether a given issue should be bought, sold, retained, or exchanged for some other.

**Intrinsic Values vs. Price**

Intrinsic value is an elusive concept.

"book value:" the net assets of the business, fairly priced.

**Intrinsic Value and "Earning Power"**: equating the two as the same markers of success

**The Role of Intrinsic Value in the Work of the Analyst**

The essential point is that security analysis does not seek to determine exactly what is the intrinsic value of a given security. **It needs only to establish either that the value is *adequate*--e.g., to protect a bond or to justify a stock purchase--or else that the value is considerably higher or considerably lower than the market price.**

- "it is quite possible to decide by inspection that a woman is old enough to vote without knowing her age or that a man is heavier than he should be without knowing his exact weight"

**Flexibility of the Concept of Intrinsic Value.**

Intrinsic value should be represented in a **range of values.**

**More Definite Concept in Special Cases**.

**Principal Obstacles to Success of the Analyst**

*Inadequate or Incorrect Data*

*Uncertainties of the future*

**Irrational behavior of the market*
