# Why Liberalism Failed Notes

Ideology in politics fails for two reasons:

1. Because it is based on falsehood about human nature, and hence can't help but fail.
2. Because as those falsehoods become more evident, the gap grows between what the ideology claims and the lived experience of human beings under its domain until the regime loses legitimacy.

Liberalism is burdened by the miseries of its success.

At its inception, liberalism promised to displace an old aristocracy in the name of liberty; yet as it eliminates every vestige of an old order, the heirs of their hopeful anti-aristocratic forebears regard its replacement as a new, perhaps even more pernicious, kind of aristocracy.

Liberalism was premised upon the limitation of government and the liberation of the individual from arbitrary political control.

Our government readily complies, moving like a ratchet wrench, always in one direction, enlarging and expanding in response to civic grievances, ironically leading in turn to citizens' further experience of distance and powerlessness.

The belief that liberalism could achieve *modus vivendi* by encouraging privatism has culminated in the nearly complete disassociation of the governing class and a citizenry without a *cives*.

### Economics

Whether people want the world "reaching into" individuals, corporations, and nation states is not a matter for discussion, for the process cannot be stopped.

Globalism is inevitable.

### Education

The rising generation is indoctrinated to embrace an economic and political system they distinctly fear, filling them with cynicism toward their future and their participation in maintaining an order they cannot avoid but which they neither believe in nor trust.

Far from feeling themselves to constitute the most liberated and autonomous generation in history, young adults believe less in their task at hand than Sisyphus rolling the boulder up the mountainside.

From a student of the author's: "We are meritocrats out of a survivalist instinct. If we do not race to the very top, the only remaining option is a bottomless pit of failure. To simply work hard and get decent grades doesn't cut it anymore if you believe there are only two options: the very top or rock bottom. It is a classic prisoner's dilemma: to sit around for 2-3 hours at the dining hall 'shooting the breeze', or to spend time engaged in intellectual conversation in moral and philosophical issues, or to go on a date all detract from time we could be spending on getting to the top and, thus, will leave us worse off relative to everyone else....Because we view humanity-and thus its institutions-as corrupt and selfish, the only person we can rely upon is our self. The only way we can avoid failure, being let down, and ultimately succumbing to the chaotic world around us, therefore, is to have the means (financial security) to rely only upon ourselves."

At the moment of liberalism's culmination, then, we see the headlong evacuation of the liberal arts. The liberal arts were long understood to be the essential form of education for a free people, especially citizens who aspired to self-government.

### Science and Technology

As the farmer and author Wendell Berry has written, if modern science and technology were conceived as a "war against nature," then "it is a war in every sense-nature is fighting us as much as we are fighting it. And...it appears that we are losing."

Today we are accustomed to arguing that we should follow the science in an issue such as climate change, ignoring that our crisis is the result of long-standing triumphs of science and technology in which "following science" was tantamount to civilizational progress.

Our carbon-saturated world is the hangover of a 150-year party in which, until the very end, we believed we had achieved the dream of liberation from nature's constraints.

**We still hold the incoherent view that science can liberate us from limits while solving the attendant consequences of that project.**

What is supposed to allow us to transform our world is instead transforming us, making us into creatures to which many, if not most of us, have not given our "consent."

**It is making us ever more into the creatures that liberalism supposed was our nature in that "state of nature" that existed before the coming of civilization, law, and government.**

Our main political choices come down to which depersonalized mechanism will purportedly advance our freedom and security-the space of the market, which collects our billions upon billions of choices to provide for our wants and needs without demanding from us any specific thought or intention about the wants and needs of others; or the liberal state, which establishes depersonalized procedures and mechanisms for the wants and needs of others that remain insufficiently addressed by the market.

Thus the insistent demand that we choose between protection of individual liberty and expansion of state activity masks the true relation between the state and market: that they grow constantly and necessarily together. 

**Statism enables individualism, individualism demands statism.**

The most challenging step we must take is a rejection of the belief that the ailments of liberal society can be fixed by realizing liberalism.

Both main political options of our age must be understood as different sides of the same counterfeit coin.

Liberalism's appeal lies in its continuities with the **deepest commitments of the Western political tradition, particularly efforts to secure liberty and human dignity through the constraint of tyranny, arbitrary rule, and oppression.**

A rejection of the world's first and last remaining ideology does not entail its replacement with a new and doubtless not very different ideology. Political revolution to overturn a revolutionary order would produce only disorder and misery. **A better course will consist in smaller, local forms of resistance: practices more than theories, the building of resilient new cultures against the anticulture of liberalism.**

## Chapter 1: Unsustainable Liberalism

There were plausible grounds why, in 1989, Francis Fukuyama could declare that the long debate over ideal regimes had ended, and that liberalism was the end station of History.

Liberalism did not discover or invent the human longing for liberty: the word *libertas* is of ancient origin, and its defense and realization have been a primary goal from the first forays into political philosophy in ancient Greece and Rome.

The Roman and then medieval Christian philosophical traditions retained the Greek emphasis upon the cultivation of virtue as a central defense against tyranny, but also developed institutional forms that sought to check the power of leaders while (to varying degrees) opening routes to informal expression of popular opinion in political rule.

Protection of rights of individuals and the belief in inviolable human dignity, if not always consistently recognized and practiced, were nevertheless philosophical achievements of premodern medieval Europe.

It was Machiavelli who broke with the classical and Christian aspiration to temper tyrannical temptation through an education in virtue, scoring the premodern philosophic tradition as an unbroken series of unrealistic and unreliable fantasies of "imaginary republics and principalities that have never existed in practice and never could; **for the gap between how people actually behave and how they ought to behave is so great that anyone who ignores everyday reality in order to live up to an ideal will soon discover that he has been taught how to destroy himself, not how to preserve himself.**"

Fukuyama held that liberalism had proved itself the sole legitimate regime on the basis that it had withstood all challengers and defeated all competitors and further, that it *worked* because it accorded with human nature.

**The potency of this threat arises from the fundamental nature of liberalism, from what are thought to be its very strengths--especially its faith in its ability of self-correction and its belief in progress and continual improvement--which make it largely impervious to discerning its deepest weaknesses and even self-inflicted decline.**

**No matter our contemporary malady, there is no challenge that can't be fixed by a more perfect application of liberal solutions.**

Among the greatest challenges facing humanity is the ability to survive progress.

According to Thomas Hobbes, human beings exist by nature in a state of radical independence and autonomy.

**Recognizing the fragility of a condition in which life in such a state is "nasty, brutish, and short," they employ their rational self-interest to sacrifice most of their natural rights in order to secure the protection and security of a sovereign. Legitimacy is conferred by consent.**

John Locke, Hobbe's successor and the first philosopher of liberalism, on the one hand acknowledges in his *Second Treatise of Government* that the duties of parents to raise children and the corresponding duties of children to obey spring from the commandment "Honor thy father and mother," but he further claims that every child must ultimately subject his inheritance to the logic of consent, and thus begin (evoking the origin of human society) in a version of the State of Nature in which we act as autonomous choosing individuals.

Even those who adopt the inheritance of their parents in every regard do so only through the logic of consent, even if it is tacit.

Liberalism often claims neutrality about the choices people make in liberal society; it is the defender of "Right," not any particular conception of the "Good."

Liberalism encourages loose connections.
