# Week 9

## 9.1: Myth and History

- What it means to be a Roman will be a theme
- Editing, and how we do it
- Accuracy is important
- Then, is focusing on these particular events a fair representation of the past
- Consider the atrocities of WW2. Yes, atrocities technically occurred on both sides. But that seems more of a mis-characterization.

## 9.2: Myth, History, and Virgil

- Virgil lived from 70 to 19 BCE (1<sup>st</sup> century BCE)
- Saying he lived through a tumultuous time would not begin to describe the environment during this period
- The Roman Empire has amassed to a substantially large portion of the world, with countless cultures mixed within it
- Romans are rightfully amazed, they are top dog in the Mediterranean
- To be a Roman
  - You have experienced a fratricidal Rome, many civil wars, nasty, awful wars
  - the Roman Republic is now gone
  - What it means to be Roman is unsure and is up for grabs
  - what comes next
- Augustus, rules Rome as the first Emperor
  - proclaims himself carrying forward old traditions when he really is making things anew
  - supports the arts, poets, with Virgil among them
  - he shares the view with Virgil of a new sense of what it is to be Roman
  - this brings this form of epic poetry
  - Virgil's poetic form works in tandem with Augustus' political project
- Many histories to Rome
- Aeneas, we've met him in Homer's hymn to Aphrodite and the Iliad
- Homeric hymn to Aphrodite:
  - Aeneas is born when Zeus is fed up with Aphrodite's mischievousness and making gods fall in love with mortals.
  - he makes it happen to Aphrodite
  - she is embarassed with falling in love with Anchises, producing Aeneas
  - Aeneas has immortal blood, but it is kind of a revenge against Aphrodite for having her weaken all those immortals by making them fall in love with mortals. Same thing's now happens to her.
  - his divine blood makes him pretty grand, not on the same level of other ancient mortal heroes.
  - early Romans hang on to this history, that Aeneas was a founding father of this city of Rome
- Other well-known stories of Rome's past:
  - Romulus and Remus, from a wolf
  - they were understood to be founders of the city of Rome back in the 8th century BCE
  - they understand their city came from this pair of twins.
  - Rome is founded when Romulus kills Remus
  - complicated history of Rome
  - that's not the one that Virgil latches onto
- instead, Aeneas returns for him
- there are names in the past Rome's, that show up behind Rome:
  - first settlement of Levinium
  - city of Alba Longa, settlement set out to found Rome
  - Latium, an ancient civilization
- all these terms are reverborating around
- before Virgil, there wasn't a solidifed authoritative narrative that strung them all together.
- Well does that
- remember Hesiod aligning all the different possibilities of divine relationships with one another through a genealogical chart, he makes sense out of this past history
- Virgil does the same, using Aeneas as a foundation
- Rome was the undisputed power in the ancient Mediterranean, something everyone agreed upon.
- Augustus sat as founder of a massive and massively successful empire
- Virgil begins to bury himself inside of this legend around Aeneus and look to a Trojan background to what it means to be Roman
- it is not very accurate that Romans had ties to Troy, but this sense of antiquity that's built into them
- not likely that there are familial lineage between Troy and Rome
- Romans chose them, **definitely not the Greeks**
- Romans thought of the Trojans before Virgil
- Virgil develops this to what Romanness is all about
- They also get something else, that they get a position that is not swallowed up by the Greeks.
- no biological background to the Greeks, their sworn enemies
- they choose a biological background to the Trojans, however
- Are they affiliating themselves to those who failed in battle?
- Virgil, talks about an early loss, now Roman is undisputed, they don't have pesky Greece around to bother them
- Romans have a cultural anxiety with respect to Greek greatness
- From Horace's "Epistle 2": `Graecia capta ferum victorum cepit`: "Greece after it was captured, the ferocious victor."
- After the Romans conquer the Greeks, they get excited by their culture, affiliating to the other side, the Trojans
- the cultural anxiety, the professor thinks, is getting worked out by making a connection with a grand past that Homer talks about but affiliating with the other side, the non-Greek side.
- this is perfectly fine for the Romans, despite being sworn enemies
- the sense of the Roman and Greek connection with a contemporary connection: 
  - some Americans admire things that happened in older cultures, European nations, those from England in particular
- We admire that, but we are culturally anxious about it
- we feel they are more sophisticated than us due to their older culture
- some resentment, from this feeling that they are superior to us
- not based on much reality, just people's fantasies
- so as in ancient Rome
- drawing the linkage of Aeneas to Rome's founding started a cottage industry for Roman aristocrats to find Trojan linkages for themselves
- all of this is the cultural stew that Virgil is entering when he tells a story
- Virgil says yes you indeed did come from the Trojans. Aeneas is the founder of our whole national identity

## 9.3: Aeneid Opening

- close attention to the opening lines like we did with Homer in the Odyssey
- the opening eleven lines give the full panoply of what's about to happen.
- he goes going to tell an epic that is about `arma uirumque`: about arms and a man.
  - Arma is a marshal world talking about arms of war
  - `Uirum` is the idea of a human male
- Virgil is giving us now an epic that are going to do not only the Odyssey, but also the Iliad
- He is going to create both the Odyssey and the Iliad before our very eyes
- first 6 books, the Odysseian part of the book
- the rest is closer to the Iliad
- `arma uirumque cano`: `cano`, he, in the first person
- unlike Homer who sings to the muses, or Hesiod singing to the muses
- Virgil says I will be the one doing the singing
- `Italiam fato`: `fato`, an important word for us
  - `fato`: in Latin, means "by destiny"
- the idea of fate, so far, is backwards-looking: there is something that happened to you in the past that is anchored to you. Look at Oedipus
- you cannot escape it
- Instead, Virgil's `fato`, it is forward-looking: no matter what you do, you will fulfill your destiny
- through Aeneas, a story is drawn along by large, arcteconic forces of the universe, that are pushing it forward, forward.
- It will bring Virgil and Aeneas to their respective home bases
- in early days, he will move from the sea coast of Troy to Italy, the Lavinian western shore. We Romans know he is coming to us.
- Virgil has our character on his way to found a city.
- `multum ille et terris iactatus et alto ui superum saeuae memorem lumonis ob iram`:
  - "He is buffered cruelly on land as on the sea by blows from powers of the air, behind them baleful Juno, in her sleepless rage."
- Juno, is a powerful force in this story that will be pulling us backwards.
- Virgil's story is certainly-forwardlooking destiny, but it is far from rosy, bright future. It will be achieved with great pain and suffering.
- The founding of Rome is a complex thing: a lot of people will be overrun.
- Individuals will be torn up in the machineries of history.
- All of it will lead towards something, but on the way they, we will look at all the vectors pushing it backward.
- Juno, is the emblem of these backward-looking vectors.
- Aeneas will have friends pushing him forward, with Juno pushing him back
- `multa quoque et bello passus dum conderet urbem inferretque deos Latio genus unde Latinum Albanique patres atque altae moenia Romae`:
  - "And cool losses were his lot in war till he could found a city and bring home his gods to Latium, land of the Latin race, the Alban lords and the high walls of Rome."
- This future toward which Aeneas is being pulled, is one that will lead him to build something.
- He's going to build a city, with walls.
- **He will make order from chaos**
- The end state will be a nicely order, well drawn city, that's put together with a careful plan
- That orders that has laws that organize people
- The enemy here is disorder and confusion
- To our friend, the victory here will be clarity and conciseness.
- We're going to see the clear straight lines what it is to be Roman
- We will consistently see Aeneas trying to build those things, they are anchored in his own heroic expression.
- Now, our muse shows up.
- `Musa mihi causas memora`: "Tell me the causes now, o muse."
- Virgil is building a reference to the epic past of Homer.
- He is talking about being inspired by the muse (or Homer), that he is not just overtaking and saying that I am the one singing the song.
- He is talking about being inspired by the muse, but it is not the first line.
- `quo numine laeso quidue dolens regina deum tot uoluere casus insignem pietate uirum tot adire labores impulerit`:
  - "How galled in her pride, and how sore at heart, and from her old wound the queen of the gods compelled him, a man apart, devoted to his mission, to undergo so many perilous days, and enter on so many trials."
- We will get to know Aeneas quite well
- He is being pushed around by this old wound that the queen of the gods has, as she's pushing him around.
- But he himself is a man apart, devoted to his mission.
- `insignem pietate uirum`: "a man marked by his pietas"
- `pietas`: piety, utterly devoted to his mission
- a hero motivated and anchored by duty
- in pursuit of the great good of his Romanness, he's giong to suffer, terrible things, the same kind of way that Odysseus did
- Then, Virgil is wondering to himself towards the end of these lines: how awfully outraged is Juno is so angry with Aeneas?
- It will take some time for him to find his feet and work his way through the challenges that are coming his way.

## 9.4: On Reading Virgil

- we'll discuss how Virgil himself thought about myth
- doesn't really to apply to Homer or the Trojans, we wouldn't get much of an answer
- we have good evidence of how he understood myth to work
- Virgil is a scholar poet, an extremely learned person.
- he is familiar with the traditions of commentary on Homer
- Virgil has a strong rationalizing impulse to him
- he'll provide redundant kind of causation for strange, wondrous, mystical kinds of events
- at the end of Book one, where Venus decides to weaken Dido by making her fall desperately in love with, with Aeneas the point where the arts of love are actually used for terrible things.
  - the myths have taught us that love is not a gentle thing, it can be used to do terrible things
  - it can undo a person
  - it definitely happens to Dido
  - Venus has Dido fall desperately in love with Aeneus
  - She uses her son Amour, who will be known later as Cupid, and reshapes her young son as the young infant son of Aeneas Ascanius.
  - Virgil's painted picture, on one hand, a godess in a powerful act of divine intervention making a woman fall in love with a man
  - on the other hand, he does it through a surrogate that takes the shape of a young infant.
  - **The puppy effect**: if someone would like someone else to be attracted to them, having a puppy on your lap is so cute the person of interest wants to come pet the puppy
    - puppies are useful ways of getting people's attention and expressing to them that you yourself might have your act together enough to care for something else so you might be a worthy mate for that person.
- Virgil tells the story having Ascanius be the object that makes Dido turn from just admiring the abstract, this figure of Aeneas, to falling passionately, deeply in love with him.
- psychologizes the whole event, having Dido in an example of this puppy effect, seeing this young infant and thinking this person might be okay, paving the road for passionate love to fall over Dido
- another example of Virgil giving us a redundant set of causations for this grandiose divine intervention, of Dido falling madly in love with Aeneas
- book three, we will see some of the household gods of Aeneas
  - they'll show up in the story, over and over
  - in the form of a dream, they will tell him that it is important that he leave Crete, as a plague is coming, and he should found a city somewhere else
  - he was considering Crete to be a place to stay before the gods told him to go
- the appearance of a god to a person is pretty exciting, but again, Virgil rationalizes it by putting it into a dream of Aeneas
  - gives us another psychological way of understanding what happens
  - then also the pestilence that gets visited upon the group means they're going to have to leave Crete anyway
  - also, it is a pure divine intervention
- the connections of the gods and what they mean is slightly changed in Virgil's story
- Jupiter (Zeus), is much more removed from the story
  - he belongs to the highest levels of the cosmos, he mostly doesn't come down
  - Romans would have known this by a Greek term, `iphare`
- Another example is Juno (Hera)
  - from the beginning, Aeneas is buffetted by blows of the air by Juno
  - she typically gets involved as a storm goddess, by actual physical storms
- Hera is not a storm goddess
- since when is the queen of the gods a storm god?
- Virgil is working from a tradition that draws on Greek scholarly work, and in fact on a long and deep allegorical reading of the goddess Hera as being associated with weather.
- Hera was an allegorical symbol for "air" due to the Greek names for both being anagrams
- real place names will be in this story
- Homer's Odyssey do not have any mappings, Virgil does
- Virgil is mapping myth onto real, historical places

## 9.5: Landing on an Unknown Shore

- we will see obvious parallels between Virgil's story and Homer's Odyssey
- Aeneas is on his way to found his home, whereas Odyssey is trying to get back to where he is from
- Odysseus: Poseidon, Aeneas: Juno
- parallels are never 100%
- Where Odysseus admires the opulence on Scyria, Aeneas admires the orderliness, with building the walls, forming the Senate
- Aeneas, has many aspects that are the same with Odysseus, Virgil makes certain there are important differences
- Homer used the bard, Demodocus, as a way to look at what it meant to be a poet
- In Virgil's telling of the importance of poetry, it is on the scale of the cosmos
- Virgil has larger ambitions for poetry than Homer did
- Virgil: read hard into my poetry and you will greatly benefit

## 9.6: Trojan War Again

- Aeneas takes over his own story and narrates to his own Carthaginian hosts
- the Trojan war has ended and Virgil has him detail the trouble and awful story of his beloved city
- Sinon, a Greek vagabond, is found with a large wooden horse
  - he claims Odysseus, Ulysses, abandoned him
  - he wants to give away their secret
  - they built the horse because they understood that Athena was very angry with them for stealing the palladium
  - Sinon is a good liar and begins to convince the Trojans that they cannot accept it inside their city, otherwise it will never be conquered
  - Liacoan, tells the Trojans that it is a lie and serpents come out of the ocean and bite and kill him
  - Lies are associated with the Greeks, and we do not like them at all
  - the Greeks come out at night after the Trojans have drank and ate and run riot throughout the city
- first thing the hero of noble cause decides to do, Aeneas, is abandon his city. He does not go down with his ship, like a good general would do.
- he has ghosts, divinities, and even his wife, entreat him to leave
- lines 780-825, Venus, brings home a Virgilian twist
  - their is a eerie proof that all is lost
  - Venus actually lifts the veil of reality and allows Aeneas to peer into the underlying things
  - he sees the hulking gods dismantling the walls of Troy, deeply disturbing
  - Homer had rage, Virgil had existential dread, that humans might have ignorance of its depths
  - we see Troy engulfed in flames
  - Venus has him carry his father on his shoulders, guiding his son by taking his hand
- Aeneas' world is shifting in darkness
- there are multiple levels to the lines in this story
- watch for these hidden forces

## 9.7: Retelling Tales

- Aeneas is out of Troy and starts his wandering tale
- very different path than Odysseus
- first they go to Thrace
- spooky things happen at Thrace
- Aeneas locates the body of Polydoras, King Priam's son who he entrusted to the king of Thrace
- after learning Priam was dead, he took the hefty ransom and killed the kid
- Polydoras is there buried in the ground, and starts springing up spooky oracles, necromancy
- they tell him this is not a good place to start a city
- then they go to Delos (Dee-laws)
- Delos is a well-known place for Apollo's oracle
- not as embedded in Greek past as Delphi
- it by no means is peripheral, but Virgil could not have him go to Delphi, that would be too Greek
- the oracle there tells them they should seek where the Trojans first came from
- some early ancestral land out there where Troy needs to be re-established
- the story that Delos tells, says this new home is an earlier home, a primal home, a re-finding of an ancient kingdom
- Virgil is giving us the story that the ancestral home of Troy was Rome
- then, they go to Crete
- it was well-known mythologically to be a very ancient place, ancestral home could well be here
- they start building their walls, lay out their plans, then something bad happens
- a pestilence befalls them, the men become sick, there is a plague
- the gods come to him in a dream and again tell him the place is in Italy
- they proceed to Italy, but first stop by the Island of the Harpees in the Strophades, on the western side of Greece
- they are things with wings that come a spoil their food
- an oracle tells them they would not ever eat anything
- they then go right past Ithaca without much mention
- Virgil, it is kind of a kiss-off to Odysseus and Ithaca, that he won't talk much about it
- then to Chaonia, in northern Greece on the Adriatic side
- we hear of Andromacee, the wife of Hector who was abducted by a man Greek named Peris, son of Achilles, after the Trojan war and taken back to this city
- Peris dies, and Hellenness, a son of Priam and another one of Peris' captains, inherits the kingdom
- a new Troy appears to be starting with some aristocrats from Troy
- seems like a good place, but the prophetic Hellenness tells them they need to find the Cibil, in the underworld, she will tell them where specifically in Italy to go
- then they go to the land of Aetna where they hear the discussion of the Cyclops
- notice they do not encounter Scylla and Caribdus
- Virgil is saying Aeneas found another way, saying he has more wisdom than Odysseus, by going around the southern edge of Aetna
- he avoids altogether the tough choice Odysseus had to make, a strong point Virgil tries to make
- on the land of Aetna, we encounter the Cyclops, through Acmenedes, one of Odysseus shipmates that Odysseus abandoned
- we are learning here and throughout the story that Odysseus is a conniving liar, brushing off of Ithaca without much mention, and how Odysseus didn't get all his men home safe
- the different values that are emerging in this story are contrast to the values in Homer's story
- Odysseus will not be embraced by Romans at all, since he is a conniving liar
- after meeting the Cyclops, we go around the southern side of Sicily and get to Drepanum
- from there, the father, Kysis, passes away
- important point because now the responsibility of passing tradition down is on the shoulders of Aeneas
- some would say Aeneas' story has both an Odyssean and Telemachus aspects to his story
- Aeneas is a young man, described by the Trojans
- he is being raised and nurtured, similar to Telemachus story
- then we go to Carthage at the end of book 1
- Dido will be important

## 9.8: Two Themes

- the Roman version of myth
- `pietas` and `tieleology`
- the idea of `pietas` shows up as a definitive marker of what Aeneas is all about
  - it means much more than being dutiful
  - piety, showing reverance to the gods
  - also, it means all the things Romans wanted to see in a man
  - follow through, getting things done through to completion
  - doing the difficult, correct thing
  - carrying through with her promises, honorable
  - it is impossible to be a Roman without this
- with Odysseus, it was `polytropos`, being able to get out of any trouble
- Romans would be like how did he get into trouble
- Aeneas shows this with his relationships with the gods, with his subordinates, being honorable to them, tries to bring them along
- he shows it also by subordinating his personal interest to the larger societal interest
- bees and ants are similes used, markers used to show how great things get done, Romans are very proud of that
- making of boundaries, building walls, is also furthering his `pietas`
- he is engaging in follow-through
- Aeneas is the great maker of boundaries, Odysseus is the great crosser of them
- Aeneas would find this behavior of Odysseus childish
- bringing order out of chaos is much more significant
- this reflects the different cultures and times:
  - Greeks were in a stage of exploration all the way into the classical Athenian age
  - Greeks were sending colonies all over the place, expansion, a culture built on expansion
  - by contrast, Romans were more concerned of maintaining a vast empire, preservation
  - put up boundaries that were enforceable, laws that could not be crossed
- be sure not to forget the times when comparing the two
- **Teleology**: mentioned in the past of a sort of destiny, moving towards a specific end
  - this was entirely absent in Homer's epics
  - definitely present in Virgil's stories
- **Universal law 8: people at the top and bottom of the power structure, tend to embrace the idea of teleology**
  - this is because they have already won
  - "of course I won, history is bringing me to the top of the heap."
  - history happens a purpose
  - history is made to bring her to the top, he asked Madonna and she said this
  - giant wheels working for you
  - at the bottom, if you are getting ground up, you like to think it wasn't your fault
  - it exonerates you from the idea that you are in your position because it is what you deserve
  - those in the middle, don't like this idea, that history moves towards a pre-determined end, it is more liked by people at either ends
- Teleology in Virgil's context
  - look at all the ways that destiny pulls Aeneas forward
  - the false starts in Thrace, Delos, Crete, Chaonia, Didos' Carthage, Sicily, all of these there is this aspiration of "Oh! We can get started." before some divine intervention saying "no, you must continue on."
  - Aeneas comes to some sort of exasperation and wants to give up, but he continues his suffering on
  - also get fate, destiny read out to us by important figures in the epic
  - Jupiter, in book one, has a famous his speech where he says, this is what will happen to Aeneas for him to found Rome
  - Crausa, in book 2, shows up to Aeneas, telling him "don't worry I'm dead. You must go ahead and found Rome. Don't abandon me." She tells him what he must do.
  - the Delian oracle, in book 3, does something similar.
  - Hellenness, also a prophetic teleological statement
- sometimes, this teleology pushes through people, overrunning them that are in the way
- Dido, is emblematic of smaller stories we've seen of people who, as the machineries of fate and destiny are pressing themselves forward, they are ground up in the gears
- if Virgil were writing some propagandistic tale, he wouldn't include this stuff

## 9.9: Dido and Marriage

- in book 4, we learn about Dido in detail

- rich psychological portrait of her with her interaction with Aeneas and her sister Anna

- she is the most complex character in these first books, more so than even Aeneas

- she welcomes them in with great hospitality

- she is building a city

- Venus sneaks up and gets her to fall in love with Aeneas through the use of her son Amour

- she is not fully in control, but we can understand how she is overcome by divine intervention

- however, her tale will not end with happiness

- Virgil, spends time watching her get ground up in the founding of Rome

- One specific scene of Dido's suffering in book 4:

  - the richest portrayal of what she goes through
  - she is on a hunt with her party and a storm comes
  - Juno and primal earth itself are invoked for a marriage
  - marriage ceremonies are marked by torches, lightning takes the role of torches
  - Virgil is telling us a marriage is happening in the cave
  - nymphs are singing, another sign of marriage
  - then, the first half, Virgil says that day was the first cause of death, and first of sorrow
  - the second half Virgil is telling us that it wasn't a marriage
  - it is quite murky what happened there
  - Does Aeneas have some sort of allegiance to Dido?
  - Aeneas doesn't think he does, but Dido does.
  - Aeneas says fate compels him to leave
  - Dido becomes very angry
  - Dido, not Virgil nor Aeneas, knows what truly happens it seems
  - Anna and Dido begin to have nasty feelings towards Aeneas
  - they perform a magical ritual, calling forth chtonic, primordial gods of the underworld: Chaos, the Chasm, Hecate, Diana.
  - it is really hard to have a final conclusion of this episode of Dido
  - many versions:
    - sympathetic to Dido:
      - we feel sorry for her, we feel her pain in a way
    - functionalist reading:
      - what social values are being underwritten, legitimized here?
      - `pietas` is being demonstrated
      - Aeneas must follow through with founding a city
      - also, Dido is practicing xenia
      - but, Aeneas pretty much says, yeah xenia is well and good in a Homeric time
    - Aeneas here shows a master Roman dominating a loved one, Carthage, who wishes to be with Rome but is eventually destroyed by Rome
      - in historical context, Carthage was the main opponent standing between Roman total domination of the Mediterranean
      - it was the duty of Romans to fulfill their duty of conquering Carthage, no matter the suffering
    - another historical component, Aeneas shuns the clutches of a North African sex goddess, thereby besting Odysseus right?
      - he escapes faults that would have been at the front of the Roman mind when Antony fell for a North African sex goddess of Cleopatra
  - of course Aeneas must leave Dido behind, he cannot fall victim to it
  - still, it is not clear what we should leave with
  - Virgil's story is very complex
  - we need to work very hard to understand what's really happening

  ## 9.10: Funeral Games for Anchises

  - book 5, Aeneas is moving from the Northern coast of Africa, with Dido, to the future: Rome, Sicily in particular
  - Sicily provides a kind of perfect medial space in between those two locations: Northern Africa and Italy.
  - it's also an island: separate from the world
  - like Scheria where Odysseus performed athletic activities in the honor of the Anchises
  - remember, Odysseus is rejuvenating and returning to himself
    - he is piecing himself back together so that later in the poem, he can take back the narrative to find his way home
  - for Aeneas, the medial position is very similar: he was unsure, wandering. Now he is much more sure of himself
  - book 6, he goes to the underworld
  - book 5 is a transition time
  - book 7 and 4 is a militaristic conquest, with much more defined parameters that require courage
  - structural ties with the rest of the story:
    - ominous fires that bookend both sides of the games
    - remember Dido's funeral pyre?
    - after the games, the ships are being burnt from women at the instruction of the gods
    - a storm drives the fleet to Sicily
    - another storm puts out the flames at the end
    - Palinurus, shows up at the beginning of the book, the steerman who gets them through the treachorous straits
    - Palinurus appears at the end of the story as he falls off the ship
    - another tie to the Odyssey
  - these activities show us a lot about Odysseus character
  - some of the competitors are cutting corners, cheating
  - Aeneas shows up as the corrector-in-chief
  - he is a strong hand at guiding people through difficult conquests
  - With his father now gone, Aeneas steps into his own and becomes a powerful person in his own regards
  - He finds ways to settle disputes: judgement, fairness
  - **taking responsibility: solving other people's problems**
  - goodwill shows up, a ton of prizes show up and Aeneas is very generous
  - he makes people feel good
  - in this book and forward, he begins to be referred to as Father Aeneas.
  - He turns to Italy from Sicily, an important historical piece in history
  - Sicily as a pathway between Carthage and Rome
