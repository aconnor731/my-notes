### 4.1 Odysseus Meets the Suitors

- Odysseus begins making his way to the center of his town
- Telemachus has learned what it means to be a **purposeful and slightly angry man**
- He starts guaranteeing things said in his own house from others
- Telemachus lies to Eumaeus, like his father
- He instructs Eumaeus to take the stranger, Odysseus, to beg from the suitors, putting him in position
- He now takes responsibility, not faulting the gods
  - He says, "I will see to it, I and the deathless gods"
- Telemachus guarantees the oaths the suitors had taken over the deal made over the fight between the stranger, Odysseus, and the other beggar, Irus
- Telemachus, "The boy you knew is gone."
  - taking responsibility not only for himself, but others' too
- He makes threats that the other suitors are not respecting
- The suitors, hypocritically, try to send out the beggar (Odysseus), when they themselves are eating out his own household
  - they are perverting xenia
  - even the lowly ones deserve xenia
  - all guest-friends come from Zeus
- Eumaeus is doing the right thing and the suitors are not when it comes to xenia
- It is not just that they are being rude to someone, they are violating something that is sacred to the Greeks
  - committing a crime against Zeus
  - "Gods arrive disguised in any way"
- Eumaeus acts a messenger between the stranger (Odysseus) and Penelope
  - Odysseus responds with, "not yet, let's wait until nighttime"
  - Odysseus doesn't respond how most would expect by dropping everything to see the queen

### 4.2 Signs as a Way of Knowing

- the story starts to move by means of secret codes and secret languages
- messages were built into the world around us, according to antiquity
- gods would send messages through dreams, birds, lightning, thunder
  - not thought to be strange coincidences but signs from the gods
- the suitors do not see the signs that the beggar, Odysseus, is not who they think he is
  - his body is much more impressive
- a sneeze marks a sign from the gods that whatever was said is indeed true
  - Homer says that the sneeze of Telemachus is like a thunder clap
- Odysseus is becoming a kind-of seer now to the suitors, although they are oblivious
- birds are being talked about
- Telyclyminous talks about prophecies due to signs
- Odysseus' inner circle are reading these signs, the suitors are not
### 4.3 What Does Penelope Know?

- Penelope is busy with her weaving and her cleverness
- She might know more than appears at first
- Athena tells her it is time for this thing with the suitors to come to a head
- Penelope asks for gifts for her hand in marriage
- She tells a lie that Odysseus told her that once Telemachus had a beard, she should take another man in marriage
- Penelope is lying with something else in mind
- This also could be that the one stranger, Odysseus, if you are Odysseus, you will know that this is a lie.
  - she is cluing Odysseus
  - he will have to compete for her by winning the ax trick
- book 19, Penelope and Odysseus come together, him still looking like a stranger
- she does not want to tip off the serving maids as they would tip off the suitors
- she asks of his name, lineage, and past
- she tells of her own weaving and unweaving
- he tells her that he has seen Odysseus at Dodona, but said he is wondering if he should come back in disguise or straight away
- Penelope is getting the message that he will be cautious upon his return
- She then tests him whether he knows Odysseus by questioning what Odysseus wore
- Both of them are very cautious due to the danger surrounding them
- Homer hints that Penelope sort of knows that these suitors are about to go down

### 4.4 The Scar

- Penelope has heard the story from the stranger and is unsure whether to trust it
- She offers for him to sleep in the inner room and wash his feet
- the maid, Eurycleia, raised Odysseus, and she knows about the scar
- a scar is a story, a trace of a remnant past
- Odysseus fears she will know it is him
- Eurycleia already says how much his build resembles Odysseus' build
- a boar is a very dangerous creature and good food
- the boar gets a gore out of Odysseus
- **Odysseus gets his name from this: "Son of Pain" from his paternal grandfather**
- Odysseus earned his own name from this scar
- the boar is waiting in a thicket, very similar to the thicket Odysseus had hidden in book 5
- Homer uses the same 4 lines to describe the thickets in both cases
- Odysseus here is **tied to the boar**
- Eurycleia knows now that the person whose feet she is washing is indeed Odysseus
- he threatens Eurycleia that he will kill her if she shares the secret, even though she is so intimate to him

### 4.5 Penelope's Dream

- **Universal Law #6: Secrecy creates intimacy**
  - corollary, must be careful though, if you want to flirt with someone, tell them you had a dream about them
- she asks the stranger, Odysseus, to interpret a dream for her
- the dream is an eagle swooping down to kill the geese eating in her courtyard and the eagle comes to her and says, "I am Odysseus come to free you"
- She is also asking the stranger, Odysseus, to be the eagle
- Odysseus is kind of at a loss of words, who is a great talker
- Odysseus was looking at her with the gate of horn, Penelope is sitting on ivory
- Gate of ivory, dreams turn out to be false, gate of horn, dreams are true
- Penelope is testing Odysseus
- very subtle
- the dream is a world that is packed with hidden meanings

### 4.6 The Bow

- no one is strong enough to string the bow, except the stranger, Odysseus
- the intimacy Odysseus has with the bow is that of a creator
- he plucks it like a lyre
- Odysseus turns and nods at Telemachus, bringing him into the inner circle, hinting for him to prepare for action

- nasty, gruesome, and graphic
- Odysseus lets the poet live (hint hint, from Homer the poet)
- Homer shows us Odysseus' mercilessness
- he punishes the unfaithful maids in a gruesome manner
- still, Odysseus, separates himself from the gods, he is doing the will of the gods
- **the divine required this, and he says he is not divine**
- the gods will use his hands to execute their demands, this is what Heroes think
- Odysseus still has to earn his way into the bed of Penelope
