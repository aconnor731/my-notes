# Security Analysis Notes

Today's investors have rightly concluded that following the cash--as the manager of a business must do--is the most reliable and revealing means of assessing a company.

Balance sheet analysis remains one generally reliable way of assessing downside protection.

Value investors generally ignore theories such as the Efficient Market Hypothesis theory (EMH), the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) as they oversimplify the real world.

Academics repudiate value investing for their more elegant yet unrealistic models and theories.

Aggressive Federal Reserve tactics create a moral hazard that encourages speculation while prolonging overvaluation.

Cable business channels, like CNBC, bring the herdlike mentality of the crowd into everyone's living room, thus making it much harder for viewers to stand apart from the masses.

Today's good businesses may not be tomorrow's.

A management's acumen, foresight, integrity, and motivation all make a huge difference in shareholder returns.

"Value traps:" inexpensively valued companies, but ultimately poor investments, because the assets are underutilized.

A value investor's dream: a company trading for less than the cash on their balance sheets.

Beta: measure of past share price volatility: a historically more volatile stock is seen as riskier.

**Someone once defined the best possible business as a post office box to which people send money.**

Today's most profitable businesses:

- sell a fixed amount of work product--say, a piece of software or a hit recording--millions and millions of times at very low marginal cost
- strong barriers to entry
- limited capital requirements
- reliable customers
- low risk of technological obsolescence
- abundant growth possibilities
- thus, significant and growing **free cash flow**

**Management's acumen, foresight, integrity, and motivation all make a huge difference in shareholder returns**.

**Value traps**:

- managers who are unwilling to make shareholder-friendly decisions risk their companies becoming perceived as this
- inexpensively valued, but ultimately poor investments, because the assets are underutilized
- typically attract activist investors seeking to unlock this trapped value

Age-old difficulty for investors: **ascertaining the value of future growth**.

Significant downside to paying up for growth or worse, obsessing over it: **"analysis is concerned primarily with values which are supported by the facts and not with those which depend largely upon expectations." (Graham and Dodd, p. 86)**

Failed growth stocks are often so aggressively dumped by disappointed holders that their price falls to levels at which value investors, who stubbornly pay little or nothing for growth characteristics, become major holders.

**A value investor's dream: purchasing a stock for a price less than the cash on their balance sheets**

Selling for value investors also requires discipline and is difficult:

- **First, sell targets, once set, should be regularly adjusted to reflect all currently available information.**
- **Second, individual investors must consider tax consequences.**
- **Third, whether or not an investor is fully invested may influence the urgency of raising cash from a stockholding as it approaches full valuation. The availability of better bargains might also make one a more eager seller.**
- **Finally, value investors should completely exit a security by the time it reaches full value; owning overvalued securities is the realm of speculators.**
  - Value investors typically begin selling at a 10% to 20% discount to their assessment of underlying value--**based on the liquidity of the security, the possible presence of a catalyst for value realization, the quality of management, the riskiness and leverage of the underlying business, and the investors' confidence level regarding the assumptions underlying the investment.**

Investors also must deal with the complex subject of risk.

Academics and professional investors have come to define risk in terms of the **Greek letter beta**, a measure of past share price volatility: a historically more volatile stock is seen as riskier.

- However, even if a stock is "risky" or volatile, if it is trading at a deeply undervalued rate, it is a very low risk investment.

**Value investors should concentrate their holdings in their best ideas; <u>if you can tell a good investment from a bad one, you can also distinguish a great one from a good one</u>.**

In a rising market, everyone makes money and a value philosophy is unnecessary. But since the market is unpredictable, **one must follow a value philosophy at all times**.

Qualities that make great value investors:

- controlling risk and limiting loss through extensive fundamental analysis
- strict discipline
- endless patience

They can expect good results with limited downside.

**You may not get rich quick, <u>but you will keep what you have</u>, and if the future of value investing resembles its past, <u>you are likely to get rich slowly</u>.**

The secret to investing is that there is no secret to investing.

That so many people fail to follow this timeless and almost foolproof approach enables those who adopt it to remain successful.

## Preface to the First Edition

In dealing with other types of security commitments, we have striven throughout to guard the student against overemphasis upon the superficial and temporary. **Twenty years of varied experience in Wall Street have taught the senior author that this overemphasis is at once the delusion and the nemesis of the world of finance.**

## Introduction to the Sixth Edition: The Historical Backdrop by James Grant

The timing seemed not so propitious in the year of the first edition of *Security Analysis*, or, indeed, that of the second edition--expanded and revised--six years later. From the 1929 peak to its 1932 trough, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 87% of its value.

At cyclical low ebb, in 1933, **the national unemployment rate topped 25%**.
