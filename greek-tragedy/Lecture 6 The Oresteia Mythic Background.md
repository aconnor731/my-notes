# Lecture 6: The Oresteia: Mythic Background

In the fifth century B.C., the Trojan War marked the end of the Heroic Age and the beginning of the human age.

Trojan War was the most fruitful of stories of Greek mythology.

Aeschylus assumed the audience already knew the Trojan War very well.

To the audience, the Trojan War actually happened, not just myth.

They knew the Gods and humans interacted freely during the Trojan War, but no longer.

Story of the Trojan War:

- Helen, daughter of Zeus, was abducted by Paris and taken to Troy
- Paris, was the judge of a beauty contest between Athena, Aphrodites, and Hera
- Paris shot and pierced Achilles heel

The Gods were angry at the Greeks for things they had done during their sack of Troy, like killing King Priam while he was holding the altar, in front of Hecuba.

- also, Cassandra, Priam's daughter, was raped by Ajax in the temple of the virgin goddess Athena
- Polyxenia was sacrificed to the death of Achilles, so the war started and ended by sacrifice of a young woman (Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, at the beginning)

House of Atreus:

- Agamemnon and Menelaus
- Helen was the wife of Menelaus
- Cyltamnaestra was the wife of Agamemnon
- suffers under a hereditary curse, generation after generation
  - moral guilt, like monetary debt, carries to the next generation
  - family implodes by children being killed by their parents

Tantalus offends the gods

- primary distinction between gods and humans: gods are immortal and humans are mortal
- tried to trick the gods into eating the flesh of his son at a banquet
  - he was trying to indicate that the gods do not know better than the humans
  - gods recognize, and resurrect him
  - Demeter eats his shoulder while her mind was on other things so they replace his shoulder with ivory
- tries to blur the line between humans and the gods through eating

If a human eats ambrosia, they can become immortal.

Tantalus is punished in the underworld by perpetual hunger and thirst.

- stands forever in a river with the water at his chin and a fruit tree just out of his reach, "tantalized," this is where we get the word

Curse continues to play out with Pelops

- his violence is not interfamilial
- he does not seem to suffer directly from the curse other than being chopped up and served to the gods
- he has to win a chariot race against Hyppodemia's father to win her hand from her father
- he bribes Oynemias charioteer Myrtleses to remove the lynchpin from the father's chariot, killing the father, and Pelops flees with Myrtlesis
- when they stop for the night, Myrtlesis tries to rape Hyppodemia, upon where Pelops tosses him off a cliff, where Myrtless yells a curse upon him and his family and descendants

Next generation, Atreus and Thiestes, kids of Pelops, are cursed because of their father Pelops

- again through the killing of children and adultery
- Mycenae, people of their, are told a child of Pelops shall rule them, but they do not know who
- these two brothers quarrel over who should rule
- they agree that whoever owns a particular fleece of a lamb
- Thiestes has the fleece
- Atreus points to an obvious omen from the gods that he should be king (the sun set in the east)
- everyone agreed Atreus should be king, so Atreus banishes Thiestes
- Atreus wonders how Thiestes got the fleece from his wife, learning she was seduced
- Atreus serves Thiestes his own son at a banquet, and reveals after Thiestes what he had just eaten
- Thiestes goes back into exile
- he fathers a son, Agesthes, to his own daughter

Agamemnon must sail to Troy, on orders of Zeus, and has to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia

- he of all people should know how horrifying it is to sacrifice one's children
