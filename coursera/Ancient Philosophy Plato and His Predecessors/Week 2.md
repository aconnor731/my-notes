# Week 2

## Part 1, Lecture 9: Parmenides' Prohibition

- Parmenides objects to the naturalist tradition
  - that the natural world is full of change
  - Parmenides argues it is incoherent
- to Parmenides, there are two roots to inquiry:
  - **is**:
    - "the one, that it <u>is</u> **and that it is not possible for it not to be**, is the path of Persuasion (for it attends upon the Truth)"
  - **is not**
    - "the other, that it <u>is not</u> and that it is right that it not be--this indeed I declare to you to be a path entirely unable to be investigated."
    - **do not take the argument of <u>is not</u>**, what Parmenides is trying to disabuse us from
      - "Hold back your thought from this route of inquiry, and do not let habit, rich in experience, compel you along this route to direct an aimless eye and an echoing ear and tongue...but judge by reasoning, logos, the much contested examination spoken by me." B7
- **is**:
  - is an affirmation:
    - France is in Europe
- **is not**:
  - a denial:
    - Europe is not an island

1. I there there is no Loch Ness Monster.
2. So, I am thinking about the Loch Ness Monster.
3. So, there *is* a Loch Ness Monster.

One premise and we must determine if it is true.

If I am thinking about something that is not real, then what am I thinking about?

**"You cannot know what is not and declare it."**

**<u>Parmenides argues that it is impossible to speak or think about 'what is not' on the grounds that there is nothing for one's thought or speech to be about.</u>**

## Part 1, Lecture 10: Parmenides Against Change

- thinking about change is thinking about what is not, Parmenides argues
- "whatever is, does not come to be or cease to be"
- One of Parmenides' central doctrines appears in fragment B8, where he claims that 'what-is' is ungenerated and imperishable

1. If something comes to be, it comes to be from what is not.
2. We cannot think about what is not.
3. So, change is unthinkable.

When there is a change, there must be a **before** and an **after**.

| Before            | After         |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| The adult is not. | The adult is. |

For ceasing to be:

| Before        | After             |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| The adult is. | The adult is not. |

- In sum, Parmenides' objection to change, is that change is either a case of **coming to be from what is not** or **perishing into what is not**.
  - **change is an incoherent notion, and is inextricably bound up with the forbidden route of trying to think or speak about what is not.**
- knowledge and truth lie on the austere path of **is** according to Parmenides
- While cosmology, which partakes of both the is and
  the is not, lies along the path of mortal opinion.
  Of those, who in his phrase are born along deaf blind alike.
  Dazed, hoards without judgement for
  whom to be and not to be are thought to be the same and not the same.
  And the path of all is backward turning. 
- Later naturalists, however, want to defend the scientific status of their inquiries,
  their claim to be seeking knowledge of the natural world.
  So they have to come to terms with Parmenides argument.
  By and large they agree with Parmenides that coming into being from
  what is not is unthinkable or unintelligible.
  But they aim to explain natural changes in such
  a way that they are not cases of coming into being, from what is not.
  So, which premise of Parmenides' argument do they reject? 

## Part 1, Lecture 11: Responses to Parmenides

- Parmenides inquiry did not bring naturalists' arguments to a halt
- "For it is impossible to come to be from what <u>in no way is</u>, and it is not to be accomplished and is unheard of that what is perishes <u>absolutely</u>." (Empedocles B12)
- **Two senses of "is"**:
  - There is no Loch Ness monster
  - **Is** there life on Mars? (**Existential**)
  - Roses are red (**Predicative**)
- "What **is not** in a way, but **is** in a way"
  - (the rose is not yellow, but exists)
- **IS NOT** (predicative) & **IS** (existential) = No Parmenidean problem!
- "What is **not red** (the apple) becomes red"
  - previously, not red, now, is red
    - coming into being from what is not
  - but what is coming into being may not be red, but it still exists
- **Solution to Parmenidean Problem**: Change involves **what is not** only in the predicative sense
- *ex nihilo*: latin for "from nothing"
- The predicative sense of 'is not' does not necessitate that something 'is not' in the existential sense. Remember the example of the red rose. It *exists* (existential) and it *is not* yellow (predicative). Despite the fact that the rose *is not* yellow,k there isn't any problem in thinking about it, since it still exists.

## Part 1, Lecture 12: Naturalism after Parmenides

- Empedocles grants to Parmenides: "no coming to be from **what in no way is**."
  - but still allow: "coming to be from what **is not in a way**."

**Parmenides' Argument**:

1. Change involves coming to be from **what is not** (predicative).
2. We cannot think about **what is not** (existential).
3. So, change is unthinkable. (Invalid inference!)

In his argument against the coherence of change, Parmenides commits the fallacy of equivocation because he trades on two different senses of the locution 'is not.'

Empedocles: "All the changes in the cosmos is the rearrangement of things already existing":

- Earth, Air, Fire, Water
  - 4 roots out of which everything is made
- Acted on by two cosmic forces: Love and Strife
  - "From these [roots] are all things are joined and compounded" (Empedocles B107)

**The Naturalist Slogan: "All generation is alteration."**

## Part 1, Lecture 13: Plato and Socrates

Plato (430-347 BCE)

- we will be reading Stephanus' edition of Plato's works
  - whenever you want to cite Plato, you use Stephanus' edition

Socrates (470-399 BCE)

- street philosopher, taught many young people of rich upbringing

- was tried and convicted by the state on grounds of impiety and ...
  - **Apology of Socrates**: (*apologia*: defense)

The Socratic dialogue became a new genre

Plato is a brilliant dramatist in writing

**It would be a mistake to believe these writings are completely historically true**

Xenophon's works of Socrates are much less more enjoyable

Xenophon's words of Socrates are very different than Plato's

Which is more accurate?

- Rather, treat the Socratic dialogue as a genre, it is more fruitful this way

**Define the motive of philosophy and defend it** - prime motive of Plato

## Part 1, Lecture 14: Socrates in the Apology

Plato distinguishes Socrates from two camps:

- Naturalist philosophers
- his contempories: Democratus

**Meletus**: "...he says that the sun is a stone and the moon earth."

**Socrates**: "My dear Meletus, do you think it's Anaxagoras you are accusing?" (*Apology 26d*)

Plato's Socrates is more concerned with the ethical questions:

- how do you live?

"the unexamined life is not worth living" (38a)

Very different questions than the pre-Socratic naturalists addressed.

Because of Socrates, Cicero says, is how philosophy was brought down from the heavens into the marketplace.

Popularly known as Sophists (wise person, or intellectual):

- Protagoras (b. 490 BCE)
  - public intellectual
- Gorgias (b. 490)

They were eagerly sought out by young men or their parents, who thought that learning the skills the Sophists taught were the key to success in public life. Much like parents today getting their kids into elite universities.

**Sophists were like higher education of today**.

Considerable public hostility against the Sophists:

- they were foreigners
- charged a fee for instruction
- the speaking and arguing that they taught was corrupting

Socrates would look like a Sophist, except he was an Athenian.

- Plato wants to resist this impression.
  - His Socrates uses arguments for a serious purpose.
  - **This is why Plato won the title of philosophy over the Sophists who were just trying to win an argument.**

## Part 1, Lecture 15: Piety in the Euthyphro

In this dialogue, we see how Socrates got the reputation of being a pest.

Euthyphro, the self-professed expert in religious matters.

- prosecuting his father strikes his contemporaries as highly impious action

Socrates asks him to demonstrate his knowledge to determine if he knows for sure that what he is doing is pious, then he must know what piety is.

**Socrates**: "Tell me, then, what do you say the pious and the impious are?"

**Euthyphro**: "Very well, I say that what's pious is precisely what I'm doing now, prosecuting those who commit an injustice..." (*Euthyprho 5d*)

**Socrates**: "But surely, Euthyphro, there are also many other things you call pious" (6d)

Euthyphro says later: "The pious is what all the gods love" (9e).

Instead of Socrates asking how he knows what is good to the gods?

**The Euthyphro Question**: "Is the pious loved by the gods because it's pious, or is it pious because it's loved?" (10a)

- famous question

Perfectly acceptable question because Euthyphro said he would tell him what makes a pious action pious.

So Socrates' question, in effect, asks Euthyphro whether the universal approval of the gods is what makes a pious action pious? Or whether the piety of an action is what makes the gods approve of it? 

Euthryphro's answer is that the gods love the pious because it is pious, not the other way around. But that means that the gods' unanimous approval is not what makes pious actions pious.

**Rather the piety of the action is what makes the gods approve of it.**

This does not provide the explanation of piety that he professes to know.

Euthyphro, it turns out, has nothing to say about what makes actions pious.

## Part 1, Lecture 16: Plato: Morality and Religion

The Euthyphro question brings about a fundamental issue about the relation between religion and morality.

In many religious traditions, including Plato's own, God, or his case the gods, are closely connected with morality. Gods are good and care about right and wrong.

Does the connection between gods and morality reveal the nature of morality about what makes things right and wrong? Or does it, rather, reveal a deep truth about the nature of the gods? That they care about right and wrong. That they are perfectly moral beings. 

Plato thinks that his contemporaries, even oddballs like Euthyphro, are committed to the latter answer. And he thinks this is the correct view to take. The gods are good and rational and what they love and hate, they love and hate for the right reasons. 

Consider how our conception of the gods would have to change if we thought their approvals and disapprovals were what made things right and wrong. 

The moral Plato intends us to draw is that piety and justice may be pleasing to the gods, but that isn't what makes things pious or just. To think otherwise, he implies, is actually disrespectful of the gods.
