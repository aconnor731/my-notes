# Lecture 6: Romeo and Juliet: The Tools of Tragedy

- **Tool: Introducing characters**: the order upon which the characters are introduced on the stage and the social position those characters occupy can give us essential insights into the deeper meaning of the play
  - Romeo and Juliet:
    1. Servants
    2. Higher servants or friends
    3. Prestigious families
    4. Heads of families
  - **hierarchy of authority**: social pyramid
- **The theme of the play is revealed through the introduction of characters and their social rank**
- Mighty opposites: Capulets versus Montegue
- End of Act 1:
  - Feuding families motif: Private version of civil war story and backdrop to *Romeo and Juliet*
- When we come to the balcony scene in Act 2, we realize it will be a much different play: **New kind of tragedy: Intimate and driven by a profound sense of human character**
  - How so? Through the use of language (words, words, words)
- The drama shifts from a public spectacle to a private intimate scene:
  - example of the **Tool: Place and person**
    - **the setting of a scene has significant thematic implication**
- the walled garden functions symbolically as a haven for the young lovers:
  - protected where their innocent love can grow
- **Extended conceit: poetic analogy**
  - major device used by all poets and particularly the poets of the English Renaissance
  - "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
    It is the east and Juliet is the sun.
    Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
    Who is already sick and pale with grief
    That thou her maid art far more fair
      than she."
    (Act II, Scene 2)
    - a cosmic comparison
- This language is not earthly, but of elevation towards Juliet
- **How is our identity linked to our name?**
  - Is the name Romeo arbitrary or does it have an essential, defining relation to what it names?
  - Can we escape our name? (Hence "Deny thy father", the play is veering towards tragedy)
- Oedipus' tragedy is about denying one's name and family connection, and his utter inability to do so
- the model of tragedy is important
- **Tool: Fate and free will**
- **Tool: Arc of character development**
- Shakespeare announces his argument about the tragedy of love, one he will return to in:
  - *Winter's Tale*
  - *Othello*
  - *Antony and Cleopatra*
- St. Augustine: "All love should ultimately tend upwards towards God"
  - if it tends toward the created rather than the creator, then it is merely idolatry, worship of the lower realm
  - this is what happens to Romeo and Juliet, they become one anothers idols
  - the friar warns them when they marry: "These violent delights have violent ends" so love moderately
- It's as if Shakespeare is cautioning us to giving too much value to the things of this world
- In the comedies, the characters can balance these emotions. In the tragedies, we see the inability to balance these emotions
- **What constitutes tragedy?**
  - Contrast to his comedies:
  - **Romeo and Juliet vs. A Midsummer Night's Dream**:
    - **Young love is blocked**
    - **Lovers attempt to escape**
    - **_Pyramus and Thisbe_ lurks in background** (the basic story behind Romeo and Juliet)
- If we take the tools to understand *A Midsummer Night's Dream*:
  - **Block to love**
  - **Altar or tomb**
  - **Friends to lovers**
  - **_Basanos_** (Greek for test, trial)
  - **Folklore**
  - **Stagecraft**
  - they are all there in Romeo and Juliet
    - Shakespeare had both on his desk at the same time (tragedy and comedy, date to same year 1595)
      - both go in very different directions
- **The pivot occurs in the Third Act**, where everything changes for Romeo and Juliet
  - It opens on a hot day in a public square
  - Tibault kills Mercucio, and Romeo in a rage kills Tibault, hours after Romeo married Juliet becoming Tibault's kinsman
  - Now he is the most hated person for Juliet's family and is banished from Verona
- **Tool: Watch for the tension between fate and free will in a character's life**
  - No matter what Oedipus does, he cannot escape killing his father and marrying his mother
  - Similar for Romeo
- In this play, there is no green world, no kind overseeing figure to help them
- **Tragedy is dominated by the role of fate**
- The true tragic voice: the hero who resists his determined fate even when he knows his resistance is futile
- Romeo is not the tragic hero in this play
- Neither the stance of resignation or outrage is the stance of a hero
- But Juliet, here is a character who continues to grow throughout the play:
  - **Tool: Arc of character development**
- We often see throughout these plays: the great characters in these tragedies have an arc of character beginning in **ignorance** and ending in **knowledge**
  - Often, this knowledge is negative
    - Lear, realizes how ignorant he was at the start of the play, when he favors his wicked daughters and favors his one wicked daughter, Ophelia
    - Or Macbeth realizes how mistaken he has been in the witches prophesies
    - Or Othello realizes he has been deceived by Iago and that his jealous murder of Desdemona was so unjust
- By the 3rd Act of the play, Juliet grows so bold in defying her father
- In the 4th Act, she must embrace the tomb to save their love
  - showing the maturation from ignorance to knowledge
- Juliet's love for Romeo reverses the cosmos
  - but it cannot succeed, as their love will be killed by the world surrounding
- **the stuff of tragic heroes: sticking to what they've sworn**
- Romeo rages against the injustice of the universe while Juliet seeks to escape the fate
- Juliet is eloquent and daring until the end
- **Tool: Tragic woman**



**Tools:**

- **Person and place**
- **Arc of development**
- **Fate and free will**
- **Tragic Woman**

These tools unlike Shakespeare's tragedies and all tragedies to come
