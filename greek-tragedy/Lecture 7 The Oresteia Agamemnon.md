# Lecture 7: The Oresteia: Agamemnon

- performed 458 B.C., 2 years before Aeschylus' death
- the three tragedies were performed together as a tragedy
- while in Egypt, a god, Proteus, told Menelaus of his brother's death
- In Agamemnon, the Watchman gives us the background
  - set in Argos, Agamemnon's home town
- The Watchman starts with: "I ask the gods for respite from these pains"
  - ominous, letting us know it will be a somber play
- The Watchman refers to Clytamnaestra as a woman with a man's heart
- **oikos**: house
  - the Watchman uses it to refer to the house itself
- The Watchman is stationed to look out for the fall of Troy signal beacons
- the idea that the expedition is ordered by Zeus is essential to our understanding
- Artemis demands Agamemnon to sacrifice his own daughter due to something Agamemnon has done to anger her, the prophet Calchus states that she was angry because two eagles killed a pregnant rabbit
  - **Artemis protects the young of all species**
  - this omen represents the walled city of Troy
  - **Artemis is angry with Agamemnon for what he *will do* and not has done**
  - "If you want to murder children, start with your own daughter"
  - Artemis to Agamemnon: if you want to go to Troy, you must kill your daughter
- at this point, Agamemnon is an innocent man that must make an inexorable and difficult choice
- making this choice to sacrifice his daughter changes Agamemnon as a man
  - "as he put on necessity's yoke..."
- "I punished the Trojans and the gods helped me do it" rather than "I was an instrument of the gods"
- upon his return, Clytamnaestra showers him, in excess, with how much she missed him and lays out cloth that Agamemnon states should only be walked upon by the gods, yet he walks on them anyways
  - this shows Agamemnon's **hubris**, or excessive pride, or in Greek: "wanton violence"
  - walking on the tapestries does violence to the gods
  - he destroys lovely things, first his daughter Iphigenia, then the tapestries, then Cassandra, his concubine from Troy
    - **main hallmark of him in this play**
- Cassandra stands silently through all of this
- Clytamnaestra tries to get her to speak but she won't
- there were silent characters in drama
- Aeschylus was known to use silent characters to great extent
- she breaks her silence by a phrase of lamentation upon dismounting the chariot, outlining her upcoming death
- the chorus does not believe her that she will be murdered by Clytamnaestra, even with her accuracy of past events
- **Cassandra is one of the most memorable and pitiable characters in the entire trilogy**
  - she knows she will be murdered upon entrance
- after she enters, the chorus can only sing 26 lines until Agamemnon cries out that he is being murdered
- when the chorus decries this heinous act, Clytamnaestra points to their hypocrisy at remaining silent upon her daughter's murder
- Clytamnaestra was manly in a sense
  - she said "I was the hunter and he was the prey"
- her attempt to re-assert her femininity does not go over well
