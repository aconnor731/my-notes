## The Polis and Greeks Overseas

### Week 2 / Lecture 1: The *Polis*

Moving from the 3 century period, the Dark Ages, after Mycenae collapsed.

Now, we move to the Archaic Age, also a 3 century period (800 - 500 BC)

- for a very long time, it was eclipsed by the glory of the classical period in the 5th century with its temple and its plays, etc.
- Now, the Archaic Age is realized to be one of the most important formative periods in Greek history.
- So much going on with the economy, military practice, agriculture, social values, law, etc.

We see a uniquely Greek cultural identity.

- date to start looking: 776 BCE, the date of the first Olympic games
- one of the few genuine dating methods that spanned across the entire Greek world
- this is the time that Greek identity became distinct from the other Eastern Mediterranean communities

What were some of the elements?

- Homer is a defining cultural entity

- The Polis, the sort of community the Greeks adopted

  - in the Odyssey, Odysseus saw the towns and learned the minds of many different men.

    - all different communities, but all have a sort of three part division: king, council, and assembly
      - king is the leader in battle, can be the high priest and chief judge
      - the Council, often made up of elders, advisers to the King
      - the assembly is generally made up of the army

  - this is sort of the base for the development of the polis

  - The Polis:

    - both on the mainland, the islands, on the coast of Asia Minor.

- Aristotle lived and wrote in the 4th Century BCE, in a time when the polis was already, as an institution, in decline.

  - we can start with his analysis

- Some Key Terms:

  - `Polis`: clumsily translated in English to "City-State"
    - two principle features: an internal unity, and an independence from communities nearby
    - **essential fact of it is that it included both the urban center and the farmland around it**
      - citizens from the farmland were had the same status of citizenry as those in downtown Athens
  - `Politeia`: incredibly complicated to describe:
    - Constitution, Citizen Body, Citizenship
  - `Polites`: someone who participates, who is an actor in the Polis, a citizen
    - No matter the Polis, the Polites were always and only native-born, free, adult male
      - women, foreigners, children, slaves were excluded from full participation in political life
  - ![map of Ancient Greece](./images/map_of_Ancient_Greece.jpg)
  - ![polis size](./images/polis-size.png)
    - the Polis varied greatly in size:
      - Attika, very large for a Polis, about 1,000 square miles
      - Sparta, in the south, with its possession of Mycenae (3,300 square miles)
      - Korintti, enormously important Polis for the entire period we will be studying, 340 square miles, some of the island communities were smaller yet

- Aristotle defines the first association of human beings as the **Household**, then they agglomerate into **Villages**, then by a process called by the great historian Louis Mumford called, an **urban implosion**, called **Synoecism**, the villages come together to form a polis.

- Urban core, sites of administrative buildings, the shrine, the market, but to repeat, it was one part of the whole of the polis

  - centered around the Acropolis

- ideology of equality underlies it all

- responsibilities and obligation towards their communities

- Aristotle thought highly of the Polis

- Polis is at the root of all the western words: politics, police, policy

- story of Theseus, the mythical king of Athens

  - his story is the myth for the creation of the polis in Athens
  - he goes to Crete and defeats the Minotaur
  - Plutarch tells us when Theseus returns to Athens, he has a great idea, combining the communities into one great community (Synoecism)
  - he sets up a temple, a common shrine, where everyone can come to worship Athena
  - he sets up games, a marker of community identity, not a trivial thing
  - also welcomed in foreigners
  - sets up a polity, a community, called Athens, citizens of Athena

- For Aristotle, the Polis is a location where human beings are meant to live

- someone who lives outside of a polis, he is either a beast or a god

- the intensity of the connection between the citizen and the city-state might be something we don't understand

- in the Archaic Age, the polis starts to be diffused

### Week 2 / Lecture 2: "The Greeks Overseas": Colonization

- around 750 to 700 BC, the polis was pretty well established
- one reason to its ascent: new type of farming, intensive
  - in the Odyssey, Odysseus visits his father Laertes on a farm like this
- Greeks started to move
  - possible reason is not having enough room for people to have these farms
- always some kind of crisis at home
- some key terms:
  - `Metropolis`: mother city
  - `Apoikia` - colony
  - `Oikistes` - the founder who set this whole community up, Theseus for example
- Mount Parnassus, the place of the temple of Apollo
  - Delphi belonged to all the Greeks, it was not under control of a single community
  - it was pan-hellenic
  - two main functions:
    - purification: murder had pollution, and it had to go to Delphi to get official purification before he could be readmitted to the community
    - prophecy: ask the priestess a question and get an answer
- pilgrimage from all over to Delphi
- before going to Delphi you would leave a small offering to your local shrine
- people would talk about what was happening in their local community
- to start a community you had to go to Delphi first to get approval (example, founding of Cyrene in Africa)
- two great waves of Greek colonization:
  - first in the mid-8th century in the west to Italy and Sicily
  - second in the Northeast towards the Black Sea
- these were organized shifts of migration
- the colonization movement began in the West
- the first colony was in the bay of Naples
  - why would they travel so far? **Iron**
  - Greeks were inclined to travel enormous distance to acquire it
- **Nestor's Cup**:
  - some of the earliest inscribed Greek writing on it
- the Greeks discovered writing again, no longer Linear-B, the clumsy 87 character syllabary, but in the form of the 24 character alphabet, borrowed from the Phoenicians, that is the foundation of most modern alphabets
- next? Colonies are established all of the Greek area
- Criteria to form a new area:
  - defensible
  - good airable land
  - natural resources
  - accessibility to trade
- Remember Odysseus scouting Cyclops' island thinking it would be a good place to set up a community
- Cyrene
  - from Herodotus
- in almost all colonial narratives, in the mother city, there is some kind of crisis, trouble
- for Cyrene, the mother city is Thera, a little island in the Cyclides
- they have a drought
- they get a prophecy to Delphi and they dodge it
- they go back to the prophet at Delphi and he reiterates to set up a colony in Libya
- they finally do, the drought ends, Battis is honored for starting it
- **unlike colonialism in the West, these colonies were not dependent on their mother city**
  - they were intended to be an autonomous, independent city
- nothing like the New World colonies that were established by the European colonies
- we are seeing the spread of `polis`, the Hellenization of the Mediterranean
- Greek influence was making itself felt far and wide
