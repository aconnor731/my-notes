# Week 2

## 2.1 - Beat, Meter, and Rhythm

We all have rhythm.

"Classical music is music without Africa." - Brian Eno, who worked with the Beatles

Elgar, "Pomp and Circumstance" (Graduation convocation song)

Debussy, "Claire de lune" (the video of a wildebeast being tackled by lions, then someone put a Nazi symbol on it to help you not feel sorry for the wildebeast)

We group the endless flow of beats to organize them.

#### Grouping Beats

- Undifferentiated beats convey a consistent pulse.
- Often, our brains subconsciously group pulses into units of 2, 3, or 4.
- These groupings lead to what we call **meter** in music, regularly recurring beats.
  - in Western music, we use *bars*, *bar lines*, to make up a *measure* and we are confined to them.
- two axes or coordinates of music?
  - **pitch** and **duration**, otherwise said as **sound** and **time**
  - pitch is on a vertical line
  - time is on a horizontal line
