# Why Liberalism Failed Notes

Ideology in politics fails for two reasons:

1. Because it is based on falsehood about human nature, and hence can't help but fail.
2. Because as those falsehoods become more evident, the gap grows between what the ideology claims and the lived experience of human beings under its domain until the regime loses legitimacy.

Liberalism is burdened by the miseries of its success.

At its inception, liberalism promised to displace an old aristocracy in the name of liberty; yet as it eliminates every vestige of an old order, the heirs of their hopeful anti-aristocratic forebears regard its replacement as a new, perhaps even more pernicious, kind of aristocracy.

Liberalism was premised upon the limitation of government and the liberation of the individual from arbitrary political control.

Our government readily complies, moving like a ratchet wrench, always in one direction, enlarging and expanding in response to civic grievances, ironically leading in turn to citizens' further experience of distance and powerlessness.

The belief that liberalism could achieve *modus vivendi* by encouraging privatism has culminated in the nearly complete disassociation of the governing class and a citizenry without a *cives*.

### Economics

Whether people want the world "reaching into" individuals, corporations, and nation states is not a matter for discussion, for the process cannot be stopped.

Globalism is inevitable.

### Education

The rising generation is indoctrinated to embrace an economic and political system they distinctly fear, filling them with cynicism toward their future and their participation in maintaining an order they cannot avoid but which they neither believe in nor trust.

Far from feeling themselves to constitute the most liberated and autonomous generation in history, young adults believe less in their task at hand than Sisyphus rolling the boulder up the mountainside.

From a student of the author's: "We are meritocrats out of a survivalist instinct. If we do not race to the very top, the only remaining option is a bottomless pit of failure. To simply work hard and get decent grades doesn't cut it anymore if you believe there are only two options: the very top or rock bottom. It is a classic prisoner's dilemma: to sit around for 2-3 hours at the dining hall 'shooting the breeze', or to spend time engaged in intellectual conversation in moral and philosophical issues, or to go on a date all detract from time we could be spending on getting to the top and, thus, will leave us worse off relative to everyone else....Because we view humanity-and thus its institutions-as corrupt and selfish, the only person we can rely upon is our self. The only way we can avoid failure, being let down, and ultimately succumbing to the chaotic world around us, therefore, is to have the means (financial security) to rely only upon ourselves."

At the moment of liberalism's culmination, then, we see the headlong evacuation of the liberal arts. The liberal arts were long understood to be the essential form of education for a free people, especially citizens who aspired to self-government.

### Science and Technology

As the farmer and author Wendell Berry has written, if modern science and technology were conceived as a "war against nature," then "it is a war in every sense-nature is fighting us as much as we are fighting it. And...it appears that we are losing."

Today we are accustomed to arguing that we should follow the science in an issue such as climate change, ignoring that our crisis is the result of long-standing triumphs of science and technology in which "following science" was tantamount to civilizational progress.

Our carbon-saturated world is the hangover of a 150-year party in which, until the very end, we believed we had achieved the dream of liberation from nature's constraints.

**We still hold the incoherent view that science can liberate us from limits while solving the attendant consequences of that project.**

What is supposed to allow us to transform our world is instead transforming us, making us into creatures to which many, if not most of us, have not given our "consent."

**It is making us ever more into the creatures that liberalism supposed was our nature in that "state of nature" that existed before the coming of civilization, law, and government.**

Our main political choices come down to which depersonalized mechanism will purportedly advance our freedom and security-the space of the market, which collects our billions upon billions of choices to provide for our wants and needs without demanding from us any specific thought or intention about the wants and needs of others; or the liberal state, which establishes depersonalized procedures and mechanisms for the wants and needs of others that remain insufficiently addressed by the market.

Thus the insistent demand that we choose between protection of individual liberty and expansion of state activity masks the true relation between the state and market: that they grow constantly and necessarily together. 

**Statism enables individualism, individualism demands statism.**

The most challenging step we must take is a rejection of the belief that the ailments of liberal society can be fixed by realizing liberalism.

Both main political options of our age must be understood as different sides of the same counterfeit coin.

Liberalism's appeal lies in its continuities with the **deepest commitments of the Western political tradition, particularly efforts to secure liberty and human dignity through the constraint of tyranny, arbitrary rule, and oppression.**

A rejection of the world's first and last remaining ideology does not entail its replacement with a new and doubtless not very different ideology. Political revolution to overturn a revolutionary order would produce only disorder and misery. **A better course will consist in smaller, local forms of resistance: practices more than theories, the building of resilient new cultures against the anticulture of liberalism.**

## Chapter 1: Unsustainable Liberalism

There were plausible grounds why, in 1989, Francis Fukuyama could declare that the long debate over ideal regimes had ended, and that liberalism was the end station of History.

Liberalism did not discover or invent the human longing for liberty: the word *libertas* is of ancient origin, and its defense and realization have been a primary goal from the first forays into political philosophy in ancient Greece and Rome.

The Roman and then medieval Christian philosophical traditions retained the Greek emphasis upon the cultivation of virtue as a central defense against tyranny, but also developed institutional forms that sought to check the power of leaders while (to varying degrees) opening routes to informal expression of popular opinion in political rule.

Protection of rights of individuals and the belief in inviolable human dignity, if not always consistently recognized and practiced, were nevertheless philosophical achievements of premodern medieval Europe.

It was Machiavelli who broke with the classical and Christian aspiration to temper tyrannical temptation through an education in virtue, scoring the premodern philosophic tradition as an unbroken series of unrealistic and unreliable fantasies of "imaginary republics and principalities that have never existed in practice and never could; **for the gap between how people actually behave and how they ought to behave is so great that anyone who ignores everyday reality in order to live up to an ideal will soon discover that he has been taught how to destroy himself, not how to preserve himself.**"

Fukuyama held that liberalism had proved itself the sole legitimate regime on the basis that it had withstood all challengers and defeated all competitors and further, that it *worked* because it accorded with human nature.

**The potency of this threat arises from the fundamental nature of liberalism, from what are thought to be its very strengths--especially its faith in its ability of self-correction and its belief in progress and continual improvement--which make it largely impervious to discerning its deepest weaknesses and even self-inflicted decline.**

**No matter our contemporary malady, there is no challenge that can't be fixed by a more perfect application of liberal solutions.**

Among the greatest challenges facing humanity is the ability to survive progress.

According to Thomas Hobbes, human beings exist by nature in a state of radical independence and autonomy.

**Recognizing the fragility of a condition in which life in such a state is "nasty, brutish, and short," they employ their rational self-interest to sacrifice most of their natural rights in order to secure the protection and security of a sovereign. Legitimacy is conferred by consent.**

John Locke, Hobbe's successor and the first philosopher of liberalism, on the one hand acknowledges in his *Second Treatise of Government* that the duties of parents to raise children and the corresponding duties of children to obey spring from the commandment "Honor thy father and mother," but he further claims that every child must ultimately subject his inheritance to the logic of consent, and thus begin (evoking the origin of human society) in a version of the State of Nature in which we act as autonomous choosing individuals.

Even those who adopt the inheritance of their parents in every regard do so only through the logic of consent, even if it is tacit.

Liberalism often claims neutrality about the choices people make in liberal society; it is the defender of "Right," not any particular conception of the "Good."

Liberalism encourages loose connections.

#### The War Against Nature

Liberal philosophy reject this requirement of human self-limitation of Aristotle's *Ethics* and St. Thomas Aquinas' *Theologiae*.

It displaced first the idea of a natural order to which humanity is subject and later the notion of human nature itself.

The first wave of this revolution--inaugurated by early-modern thinkers dating back to the Renaissance--**insisted that man should employ natural science and a transformed economic system to seek mastery of nature.**

The second wave--developed largely by various historicist schools of thought, especially in the nineteenth century--**replaced belief in the idea of a fixed human nature with belief in human "plasticity" and capacity for moral progress.**

These two iterations of liberalism are often labeled "conservative" and "progressive".

Francis Bacon (Hobbes was Bacon's secretary) was the first who attacked these principles, arguing that the human capacity to "master" or "control" nature could go so far to reversing the effects of the Fall, including even the possibility of overcoming human mortality.

The second wave consisted of thinkers ranging from Rousseau to Marx, from Mill to Dewey, and from Richard Rorty to contemporary "transhumanists" reject the idea that human nature is fixed. They adopt the first-wave theorists' idea that nature is subject to human conquest and apply it to human nature itself.

Conservatives, first wave theorists, argue the need of scientific and economic mastery of nature but stop short of most forms of biotechnological "enhancement".

Second wave liberals are for liberating humans from the biological nature of our own bodies.

**Liberalism rejects the ancient conception of liberty as the learned capacity of human beings to conquer the slavish pursuit of base and hedonistic desires. This kind of liberty is a condition of self-governance of both city and soul, drawing closely together the individual cultivation and practice of virtue and the shared activities of self-legislation.**

Liberalism instead understands liberty as the condition in which one can act freely within the sphere unconstrained by positive law.

As the authority of social norms dissipates, they are increasingly felt to be residual, arbitrary, and oppressive, motivating calls for the state to actively work toward their eradication.

Liberalism thus culminates in two ontological points: the liberated individual and the controlling state.

Liberalism can function only by the constant increase of available and consumable material goods, and thus with the constant expansion of nature's conquest and mastery.

<u>**No person can aspire to a position of political leadership by calling for limits and self-command.**</u>

Liberalism's end game is unsustainable in every respect: **it cannot perpetually enforce order upon a collection of autonomous individuals increasingly shorn of constitutive social norms, nor can it provide endless material growth in a world of limits. We can either elect a future of self-limitation born of the practice and experience of self-governance in local communities, or we can back inexorably into a future in which extreme license coexists with extreme oppression.**

## Chapter 2: Uniting Individualism and Statism

**The project of advancing the liberal order takes the superficial form of a battle between seemingly intractable foes, and the energy and acrimony of that contest shrouds a deeper cooperation that ends up advancing liberalism as a whole.**

These apparently contrary positions are familiar to even the casual observer of contemporary American politics, with conservatives--heirs to classical liberalism--typically decrying statism and liberals--heirs to progressivism--criticizing individualism.

This deeper continuity between right and left derives from two main sources: first, philosophical, with both the classical and progressive liberal traditions arguing ultimately for the central role of the state in the creation and expansion of individualism; and second, practical and political, with this joint philosophical project strengthening an expansion of both state power and individualism. **The two "sides" of liberalism, while apparently locked in intense contestation, together advance the main objects of the liberal project.**

**Thus classical liberals claim that the individual is fundamental and, through an act of contract and consent, brings into existence a limited government. Progressive liberals claim that the individual is never wholly self-sufficient, and that we must instead understand ourselves to be more deeply defined by membership in a larger unit of humanity.**

For both "liberals" and "conservatives," the state becomes the main driver of individualism, while individualism becomes the main source of expanding power and authority of the state.

#### Philosophical Sources and Practical Implications--Classical Liberalism

Liberalism establishes a deep and profound connection: its ideal of liberty can be realized only through a powerful state.

#### Philosophical Sources and Practical Implications--Progressive Liberalism

Democracy could no longer mean individual self-reliance based upon the freedom of individuals to act in accordance with their own wishes. Instead, it must be infused with a social and even religious set of commitments that would lead people to recognize their participation in the "brotherhood of mankind."

Walter Rauschenbusch was to echo this sentiment in his call to establish the "Kingdom of God" on earth, a new and more deeply social form of democracy that "would not accept human nature as it is, but move it in the direction of its improvement."

Only through overcoming classic liberalism can progressive liberalism emerge, according to these thinkers.

#### Creating the Individual

At the heart of liberal theory and practice is the preeminent role of the state as agent of individualism.

**This very liberation in turn generates liberalism's self-reinforcing circle, wherein the increasingly disembedded individual ends up strengthening the state that is its own author.**

Just as the potential of a plant or animal isn't possible without cultivation, so it was readily understood that the human creature's best potential simply could not be realized without good culture.

The effect of liberalism is at once to liberate humans from acknowledgement of nature's limits while rendering culture into wholly relativist belief and practice, untethered from anything universal or enduring.

#### Liberal Timelessness

Liberalism makes humanity into mayflies, and unsurprisingly, its culmination has led each generation to accumulate scandalous levels of debt to be left for its children, while rapacious exploitation of resources continues in the progressive belief that future generations will devise a way to deal with the depletions.

Liberalism looks to fulfill the short-term, ephemeral ambitions due to the presentism aspect of life, where the present is all that exists and the future and past do not exist.

Culture educates us about our generational debts and obligations.

Culture is the practice of full temporality, an institution that connects the present to the past and the future.

Culture expands the human experience of time, making both the past and the future present to creatures who otherwise experience only the present moment.

#### Liberalism as Nowhere and Everywhere

Liberalism valorizes placelessness.

We are not subject to our place of birth or genealogy.

According to poet and essayist Wendell Berry, community is more than a collection of self-interested individuals brought together to seek personal advancement. Rather, it "lives and acts by the common virtues of trust, goodwill, forbearance, self-restrain, compassion, and forgiveness."

Berry is not hesitant to acknowledge that community is a place of constraint and limits.

Indeed, in this simple fact lies its great attraction.

Absent the supports of communal life, family life is hard-pressed to flourish.

Berry commends,

"arrangements [that] include marriage, family structure, divisions of work and authority, and responsibility for the instruction of children and young people. These arrangements exist, in part, to reduce the volatility and dangers of sex--to preserve its energy, its beauty, and its pleasure; to preserve and clarify its power to join not just husband and wife to one another but parents to children, families to the community, the community to nature; to ensure, so far as possible, that the inheritors of sexuality, as they come of age, will be worthy of it."

For Berry, the common good can be achieved only in small, local settings.

Larger units than the locality or the region can flourish in the proper sense only when their constitutive parts flourish.

Modern liberalism, by contrast, insists on the priority of the largest unit over the smallest, and seeks everywhere to impose a homogenous standard on a world of particularity and diversity.

Echoing Giambattista Vico, an early critic of deracinated rationalism of Descartes and Hobbes, Berry defends what Vico named the *sensus communis*. Such "common knowledge" is the result of the practice and experience, the accumulated store of wisdom born of trials and corrections of people who have lived, suffered, and flourished in local settings.

In Berry's thought, there is a considerable respect for the dignity of "common sense," a nonexpert way of understanding the world that comes through experience, memory, and tradition, and is the source of much democratic opinion that liberalism typically dismisses.

#### The Death of Culture and the Rise of Leviathan

While our main political actors argue over whether the liberal state or the market better protects the liberal citizen, they cooperate in the evisceration of actual cultures.

As Solzhenitsyn noted,

"If one is right from a legal point of view, nothing more is required, nobody may mention that one could still not be entirely right, and urge self-restraint or a renunciation of these rights, call for sacrifice and selfless risk: this would simply sound absurd. *Voluntary self-restraint is almost unheard of:* everyone strives toward further expansion to the extreme limit of legal frames."

**Solzhenitsyn cut to the heart of liberalism's great failing and ultimate weakness: <u>its incapacity to foster self-governance.</u>**

Some fifty years after students were liberated from the nanny college, we are seeing not a sexual nirvana but widespread confusion and anarchy, a new form of *in absentia parentis*--the paternalist state.

**This immorality tale is the Hobbesian vision in microcosm:** 

- **first, tradition and culture must be eliminated as arbitrary and unjust ("natural man").**
- **Then we see that absent such norms, anarchy ensues ("the state of nature").**
- **Finding this anarchy unbearable, we turn to a central sovereign as our sole protector, that "Mortall God" who will protect us from ourselves ("the social contract").**

Considering the 2008 mortgage crisis, the response has been the same: calls for greater government regulation and oversight over the consequences of untrammeled appetite, with threats of penalties (rarely enforced) and a massive expansion of the administrative state to oversee a basic human interaction--**the effort to secure shelter.**

Liberation from the confinements and limitations of local market cultures brings not perfect liberty but the expansion of Leviathan. The destruction of culture achieves not liberation but powerlessness and bondage.

**The dissolution of culture is simultaneously the prerequisite for the liberation of the disembedded market, and for the empowerment of the state.**

#### Parasitic Liberalism

Evidence of our anticulture surrounds us yet is pervasively denied.

**Rather than produce our own cultures, grounded in local places, embedded in time, and usually developed from an inheritance from relatives, neighbors, and community--music, art, storytelling, food--we are more likely to consume prepackaged, market-tested, mass-marketed consumables, often branded in commercialized symbolism that masks that culture's evisceration.**

Invocations of "culture" tend to be singular, not plural, whereas actual cultures are multiple, local, and particular.

- this is commonly known as "popular culture," a market-tested and standardized product devised by commercial enterprises and meant for mass consumption.

Whereas culture is an accumulation of local and historical experience and memory, liberal "culture" is the vacuum that remains when local experience has been eviscerated, memory is lost, and every place becomes every other place.

A panoply of actual cultures is replaced by celebration of "multiculturalism," the reduction of actual cultural variety to liberal homogeneity loosely dressed in easily discarded native garb.

The homogenous celebration of every culture effectively means no culture at all.

By contrast, while cultures are many and varied, their common features almost always include **a belief in the continuity between human and nature and the natural world.**

## Chapter 4: Technology and the Loss of Liberty

We believe technology could both lead us to our salvation and extermination.

Far from controlling our technology for our own betterment, we find that the technology ends up ether ruling or destroying us.

#### Android Humanity

Studies show social media is changing us, mainly for the worse.

Carr has found measurable increases in the areas of the brain responsible for decision making and problem solving due to increased exposure to technology. But those gains are accompanied by significant losses in language facility, memory, and concentration.

He argues we are becoming shallow, not in a superficial way, but physiologically.

The internet is making us dumber.

MIT's Sherry Turkle, in her book *Alone Together*, has found that modern social media doesn't create new communities as it substitutes for the real world communities that it destroys.

"Community": to give among each other

Turkle seems resigned to dim prospects of fundamentally changing the current dynamic.

Wendell Berry has argued that machine technology has its own logic, which tends to destroy the practices and traditions of a community.

Neil Postman, in his book *Technopoly* writes, "Everything must give way, in some degree, to their development...Tools are not integrated into the culture; they attack the culture. They bid to *become* the culture. As a consequence, tradition, social mores, myth, politics, ritual, and religion have to fight for their lives."

From technocracy we have entered the age of "technopoly," in which a culturally flattened world operates under an ideology of progress that leads to **"the submission of all forms of cultural life to the sovereignty of technique and technology."**

**Our anxiety arises from the belief that we may no longer control the technology that is supposed to be a main tool of our liberty.**

Our popular culture seems to be a kind of electronic Cassandra, seeing the future but unable to get anyone to believe it.

#### The Technology of Liberalism

As he has argued throughout, liberalism above all advances a new understanding of liberty.

**In the ancient world--whether pre-Christian antiquity, particularly ancient Greece, or during the long reign of Christendom--the dominant definition of liberty involved recognition that it required an appropriate form of <u>self-governance</u>**.

Ancient thought sought a "virtuous circle" of polities that would support the fostering of virtuous individuals, and of virtuous individuals who would form the civic life of a polity oriented toward the common good.

To be free, above all, was to be **free from enslavement to one's own basest desires**, which could never be fulfilled, and the pursuit of which could only foster ceaseless craving and discontent.

Liberty was thus the condition achieved by self-rule, over one's own appetites and over the longing for political dominion.

This definition of liberty was rejected by modern thinkers.

**Liberty, as defined by the originators of modern liberalism, was the condition in which humans were completely free to pursue whatever they desired.**

Its opposite was thus conceived as **constraint.**

Liberty was no longer, as the ancients held, the condition of just and appropriate self-rule.

The old political orders, previously devoted to the inculcation of virtue and the commendation of common good, were attacked early on by Niccolo Machiavelli as **"imaginary republics and principalities," dealing in *oughts* rather than taking humans as they actually are.**

The Constitution is the embodiment of a set of modern principles that sought to overturn ancient teachings and shape a distinctly different modern human.

The new modern liberal philosophy aspires to the self-interest, unleashed ambition of individuals over the ancient commendation of virtue and aspiration to the common good.

It is less a matter of our technology "making us" than of our deeper political commitments shaping our technology.

Marche notes in his Atlantic article, *Is Facebook Making Us Lonely*, that **Facebook and technologies like it, have facilitated or even enabled a preexisting predilection--the long-standing American desire to be independent and free.**

As Marche points out, **"Loneliness is one of the first things that Americans spend their money achieving...We are lonely because we want to be lonely. We have made ourselves lonely."**

Technologies like Facebook, he writes, **"are the by-product of a long-standing national appetite for independence."**

Certain Amish communities ban members from purchasing insurance. Rather, the community itself is their "insurance pool": members seek to foster a community where it is everyone's shared responsibility and obligation to make someone who suffers a loss "whole" again.

**<u>In contradiction to our contemporary political discourse, which suggests that there is some conflict between the individual and centralized power, we need to understand that ever-expanding individual liberty is actually the creation of a sprawling and intricate set of technologies that, while liberating the individual from the limitations of both nature and obligation, leave us feeling increasingly powerless, voiceless, alone--and unfree.</u>**

## Chapter 5: Liberalism against Liberal Arts
