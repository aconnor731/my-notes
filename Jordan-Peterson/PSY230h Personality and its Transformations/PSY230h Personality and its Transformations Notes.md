# PSY230h: Personality and its Transformations Notes

## Lecture 2, Historical Perspectives: Mythological Representations

- Freud's *superego* is like having your critical father talking to you inside your mind.
  - makes sense because of our societal belief in the "all seeing eye"
- Nietzsche advocated that Christianity had left its axiomatic truths. He then announced God is dead and that we killed him.
  - after its death, he pointed at communism as our future (same with Dostoyevsky)
- Hume: "You cannot derive an ought from an is."

### The Language of Mythology

- But what is it that every human being shares, regardless of place and time of birth?
- The constituent elements: you, the known, the unknown or you, your culture, and nature

### The Known

- culture, appolinian control, superego, the conscious
- the king, the patriarch, the plough, the phallus
- order and authority and the crushing weight of tradition
- the wise old man and the tyrant
- dogma, the day sky
- the countryman
- the island, the heights
- the ancestral spirits
- the activity of the dead

Captain Hook is a tyrant. Peter Pan doesn't want to grow up to become him. That's why Peter Pan doesn't want to grow up at all because all adults are tyrants. Captain Hook is a tyrant because he lost his hand to a crocodile with a clock in his belly. He lost it to time.

Remember, Peter Pan doesn't get Wendy. Tinkerbell doesn't exist. That is why you must grow up.

Culture has a positive element and a negative element. Nature is the same.

Nature kills you and culture keeps you alive.
