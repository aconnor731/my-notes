# Chapter 22: Privileged Issues

This section regards bonds and preferred stocks presumed by the buyer to be subject to substantial change in principal value.

Two groups to these:

- speculative due to inadequate safety
- speculative because they possess a conversion or similar privilege which makes possible substantial variations in market price

## Senior Issues with Speculative Privileges

A bond or preferred stock may also be given the right to share in benefits accruing to the common stock. There are three kinds:

1. Convertible--can exchange the senior issue for common stock on stipulated terms
2. Participating--additional income may be paid to the senior security holder, dependent usually upon the amount of common dividends declared.
3. Subscription--holders of the bond or preferred stock may purchase common shares, at prices, in amounts, and during periods, stipulated.

**Conversion privilege is most common and will be called "convertible issues."**

### Such Issues Attractive In Form.

A bond that meets all the requirements of a sound investment and in addition possesses an interesting conversion privilege would undoubtedly constitute a highly desirable purchase.

### Their Investment Record Unenviable: Reasons.

The conversion feature has most often bee offered to compensate for inadequate security. Most common during 1926-1929.

- strongly entrenched industrial enterprises raised money through sales of common stock, whereas the weaker--or weakly capitalized--undertakings resorted to privileged senior securities.

Another reason is that the bond could be dependent on the price of the common stock, and can become speculative.

### _Unlimited Profit in Such Issues Identified with Stockholder's Position._

This is in an important sense illusory.

**<u>The range of possibilities for a convertible issue, _although still maintaining the advantage of an investment holding_, must usually be limited to somewhere between 25 and 35% of its face value.</u>**

Typically, originally purchasers hold them for a fraction of the maximum market gains scored by the most successful among them. They don't realize these very large profits.

### Examples of Attractive Issues.

Although _most_ new convertible offerings may have been inadequately secured, there are fairly frequent exceptions to the rule, and **these exceptions should be of prime interest to the alert investor.**

Many of the bonds were adequately secured based on their earnings showing continued improvement.

### Example of an Unattractive Issue.

No matter the offerings, earnings must be adequate to secure the bond.

### Principle Derived.

**<u>Investment Principle: _A privileged senior issue, selling close to or above face value, must meet the requirements either of a straight fixed-value investment or of a common-stock speculation, and it must be bought with one or the other qualification clearly in view._</u>**

The *investor* interested in safety of principal should not abate his requirements in return for a conversion privilege; the *speculator* should not be attracted to an enterprise of mediocre promise because of the pseudo-security provided by the bond contract.

- **_Not in the middle of the two!_**

### Rules Regarding Retention or Sale.

Such issues should be bought with the *possibility* of long-term holding in mind but with the *hope* that the potential profit will be realized fairly soon.

**<u>Investment Principle: _In the typical case, a convertible bond should not be converted by the investor. It should either be held or sold._</u>**

Converting to common stock means the investor is abandoning the priority and the unqualified claim to principal and interest upon which the purchase was originally premised. If the stock goes down, he risks losing both.

The careful investor is again likely to find a reasonable number of attractive opportunities presented in this field.
