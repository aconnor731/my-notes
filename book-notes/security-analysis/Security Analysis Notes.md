# Security Analysis Notes

Today's investors have rightly concluded that following the cash--as the manager of a business must do--is the most reliable and revealing means of assessing a company.

Balance sheet analysis remains one generally reliable way of assessing downside protection.

Value investors generally ignore theories such as the Efficient Market Hypothesis theory (EMH), the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) as they oversimplify the real world.

Academics repudiate value investing for their more elegant yet unrealistic models and theories.

Aggressive Federal Reserve tactics create a moral hazard that encourages speculation while prolonging overvaluation.

Cable business channels, like CNBC, bring the herdlike mentality of the crowd into everyone's living room, thus making it much harder for viewers to stand apart from the masses.

Today's good businesses may not be tomorrow's.

A management's acumen, foresight, integrity, and motivation all make a huge difference in shareholder returns.

"Value traps:" inexpensively valued companies, but ultimately poor investments, because the assets are underutilized.

A value investor's dream: a company trading for less than the cash on their balance sheets.

Beta: measure of past share price volatility: a historically more volatile stock is seen as riskier.

**Someone once defined the best possible business as a post office box to which people send money.**

Today's most profitable businesses:

- sell a fixed amount of work product--say, a piece of software or a hit recording--millions and millions of times at very low marginal cost
- strong barriers to entry
- limited capital requirements
- reliable customers
- low risk of technological obsolescence
- abundant growth possibilities
- thus, significant and growing **free cash flow**

**Management's acumen, foresight, integrity, and motivation all make a huge difference in shareholder returns**.

**Value traps**:

- managers who are unwilling to make shareholder-friendly decisions risk their companies becoming perceived as this
- inexpensively valued, but ultimately poor investments, because the assets are underutilized
- typically attract activist investors seeking to unlock this trapped value

Age-old difficulty for investors: **ascertaining the value of future growth**.

Significant downside to paying up for growth or worse, obsessing over it: **"analysis is concerned primarily with values which are supported by the facts and not with those which depend largely upon expectations." (Graham and Dodd, p. 86)**

Failed growth stocks are often so aggressively dumped by disappointed holders that their price falls to levels at which value investors, who stubbornly pay little or nothing for growth characteristics, become major holders.

**A value investor's dream: purchasing a stock for a price less than the cash on their balance sheets**

Selling for value investors also requires discipline and is difficult:

- **First, sell targets, once set, should be regularly adjusted to reflect all currently available information.**
- **Second, individual investors must consider tax consequences.**
- **Third, whether or not an investor is fully invested may influence the urgency of raising cash from a stockholding as it approaches full valuation. The availability of better bargains might also make one a more eager seller.**
- **Finally, value investors should completely exit a security by the time it reaches full value; owning overvalued securities is the realm of speculators.**
  - Value investors typically begin selling at a 10% to 20% discount to their assessment of underlying value--**based on the liquidity of the security, the possible presence of a catalyst for value realization, the quality of management, the riskiness and leverage of the underlying business, and the investors' confidence level regarding the assumptions underlying the investment.**

Investors also must deal with the complex subject of risk.

Academics and professional investors have come to define risk in terms of the **Greek letter beta**, a measure of past share price volatility: a historically more volatile stock is seen as riskier.

- However, even if a stock is "risky" or volatile, if it is trading at a deeply undervalued rate, it is a very low risk investment.

**Value investors should concentrate their holdings in their best ideas; <u>if you can tell a good investment from a bad one, you can also distinguish a great one from a good one</u>.**

In a rising market, everyone makes money and a value philosophy is unnecessary. But since the market is unpredictable, **one must follow a value philosophy at all times**.

Qualities that make great value investors:

- controlling risk and limiting loss through extensive fundamental analysis
- strict discipline
- endless patience

They can expect good results with limited downside.

**You may not get rich quick, <u>but you will keep what you have</u>, and if the future of value investing resembles its past, <u>you are likely to get rich slowly</u>.**

The secret to investing is that there is no secret to investing.

That so many people fail to follow this timeless and almost foolproof approach enables those who adopt it to remain successful.

## Preface to the First Edition

In dealing with other types of security commitments, we have striven throughout to guard the student against overemphasis upon the superficial and temporary. **Twenty years of varied experience in Wall Street have taught the senior author that this overemphasis is at once the delusion and the nemesis of the world of finance.**

# Security Analysis

## Introduction to the Sixth Edition: The Historical Backdrop by James Grant

The timing seemed not so propitious in the year of the first edition of *Security Analysis*, or, indeed, that of the second edition--expanded and revised--six years later. From the 1929 peak to its 1932 trough, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 87% of its value.

At cyclical low ebb, in 1933, **the national unemployment rate topped 25%**.

“I blamed myself not so much for my failure to protect myself against the disaster I had been predicting,” Graham writes, “as for having slipped into an extravagant way of life which I hadn’t the temperament or capacity to enjoy. I quickly convinced myself that the true key to material happiness lay in a modest standard of living which could be achieved with little difficulty under almost all economic conditions”—the margin-of-safety idea applied to personal finance.

## Introduction to Part 1: By Roger Lowenstein

There is a misconception that trying to make serious money requires that one take serious risks. In fact, **the converse is true**. Avoiding serious loss is a *precondition* for sustaining a high compound rate of growth.

Graham was the rare academic who was both theoretician and working practitioner.

*At a price*, any security can be a suitable investment, but, to repeat, none is safe merely by virtue of its form.

According to Graham and Dodd, "an investment," we are told in a carefully chosen phrase, is an operation "that promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return." This is not an ironclad guarantee as some promises are broken. But it does assume a high degree of certainty.

Graham and Dodd insisted that "safety must be based on study and on standards," in particular, study of the published financials.

"Intrinsic value" is the worth of an enterprise to one who owns it "for keeps." Logically, it must be based on the cash flow that would go to a continuing owner over the long run, as distinct from a speculative assessment of its resale value.

**Part 1 in summation, Graham and Dodd told investors to look for securities at a hefty discount to what they are worth.**

Defining intrinsic value can never be precise. Instead, investors think in terms of a range of values. How Graham and Dodd described it: "It is quite possible to decide by inspection that a woman is old enough to vote without knowing her age or that a man is heavier than he should be without knowing his weight."

**Precision is in any case unnecessary because the aim is to pay a good deal *less* than intrinsic value, so as to provide a margin of safety.**

While intrinsic value measures the economic potential--what an owner might hope to get *out* of an asset--book value is an arithmetic computation of what has been invested *into* it. Although, book value alone **cannot be determinative**. If you invested equal sum in two auto companies, one run by Toyota and the other by General Motors, the book values would be equal, but their intrinsic or economic values would be very different.

Graham and Dodd did *not* fall into this error; they stated plainly that, in terms of forecasting course of stock prices, **book value was "almost worthless as a practical matter."**

In the 1930s, markets were so depressed that it was not uncommon for stocks to sell at less than the value of their cash on hand, even after subtracting their debt (This was akin to buying a home for less than the amount of money in the bedroom safe and getting to keep the safe as well!).

Valuing equities involves a calculation of what a company should be able to earn each year, going forward, as distinct from taking a snapshot of the assets it has at the moment.

**To forecast earnings with any degree of confidence is extremely difficult.** The best guide can only be what a company has earned in the past.

In estimating future earnings (for any sort of business), *Security Analysis* provides two vital rules:

- One, is that companies with stable earnings are easier to forecast and hence preferable.
  - also, the more volatile, the more cautious one should be
- Second, earnings tend to fluctuate according to a cyclical pattern.
  - **A firm's *average* earnings can provide a rough guide to the future; the earnings *trend* is far less reliable**
    - just because a player hits .300 for a week, with an established average of .250, it cannot be assumed that he will necessarily hit that well for the rest of the season

Companies can dress up their earnings statements, but they can't manufacture cash. **Thus, when the income statement and the cash flow statement start to diverge, it's a signal that somethings is amiss.**

Graham and Dodd paid more attention to the balance sheet, which records a moment in financial time, than to earnings and cash flow statements, which depict the change over a previous quarter or year, because such information was either not available or not very detailed.

**As a rule of thumb, investors should spend the bulk of their time on the disclosures of the security under study, and they should spend significant time on the reports of competitors.**

- both the balance sheet and the statement of cash flow will throw significant light on the number that Wall Street pays the most attention to, the reported earnings.
