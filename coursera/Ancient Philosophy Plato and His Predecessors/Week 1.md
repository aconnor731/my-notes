# Week 1

Characteristic of philosophy: **logos**

Can mean word, or speech, or argument, or account, or more generally, reason.

It is the root for the names of many scientific disciplines today: psychology, biology, cosmology, etc.

Other questions still remain within the domain of philosophy:

- ethics
- knowledge
- nature of reality

Two central figures: **Plato** and **Aristotle**

In the fresco, painting *School of Athens* by Raphael, Plato and Aristotle are in the center, with Plato on the left.

Plato: 430 - 347 BCE

Aristotle: 384 - 323 BCE

In the painting, one can see many of Plato's predecessors: Anaximander, Anaxagoras, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, and Plato's teachers, Socrates

Also, we see Aristotle's predecessors:

- cynic philosopher: Diogenes
- Zeno, the founder of Stoicism
- Epicurus, who founded the Epicurean school of philosophy
- even Plotinus, who was part of a revival of Platonism about 600 years after the birth of Plato.

Part 1 of the course, we will study Plato and his pre-Socratic predecessors.

Part two, we will study Aristotle, the Epicureans, and the Stoics.

## Part 1, Lecture 2: How we Study the Pre-Socrates

Pre-Socratic philosophers:

- Thales, 625 BCE
- Anaximander, 610 BCE
- Anaximenes, ?600 BCE
- Heraclitus, 540 BCE
- Parmenides, 515 BCE
- Anaxagoras, 500 BCE

We don't have any of the books they wrote

## Part 1, Lecture 3: Fragments and Sources

### Conventions for Understanding Pre-Socratic Philosophy

- information taken from later writers
- two types: **Fragments** and **Testimonia**
- Testimonia: paraphrases, summaries, reports, etc., marked with **A**
- Fragments: actual quotations, marked with the letter **B**
- An Example:
  "Listen not to me, but to the *logos*. It is wise to agree that all things are one." (*Heraclitus B50*)
  - B: actual quotation
  - 50: 50<sup>th</sup> fragment as printed in Diels-Kranz
- Thales:
  - none are actual quotations, and are all denoted with A
- DK 11A9:
  - 11: *Thales, Ch. 11 of DK*
  - A: Testimonia
  - 9: 9<sup>th</sup> in DK
- **the DK numbers are the standard way for citing pre-Socratic texts**
- these thinkers were considered by Aristotle as such:
  "Those who first pursued philosophy" - Aristotle (DK 11A12)

## Part 1, Lecture 4: Philosophers or Scientists?

- the First Philosophers, the pre-socratics, denoted by Aristotle: **Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes**
  - **the first natural scientists in the Western tradition**
- they were Milesians, citizens of Miletus in Ionia, a Greek colony on the west coast of what is modern-day Turkey, in the 6<sup>th</sup> century
- **Thales**:
  - considered the earliest, hence the first philosopher
  - he was too busy star-gazing that he fell into a well
  - so he is an astronomer
  - Aristotle tells that Thales addressed the charge is useless by using astronomy to predict a large crop of olives to come. So he bought some cheaply and made a profit.
  - successfully predicted an eclipse in 585 BCE
- Milesians, are interested in the natural wonders of the world, **Naturalists**
- **logos**: speech, reason, account, explanation: Biology, Zoology, Anthropology

## Part 1, Lecture 5: The Material Principle

- what is distinctive of their practice: the material basics of the natural world, what is the natural world made up materially as a fundamental entity
- Anaximenes: "air is the fundamental thing"
- Anaximander: "unbounded, infinite" (apeiron)
- Thales: water is fundamental

### Shared Outlook in Milesian Natural Philosophy

1. Seek to understand natural phenomena from the inside out
   1. Not by invoking gods like Olympian Gods of Zeus, Apollo, and Hera, unlike Homer does

## Part 1, Lecture 6: God in Nature?

### Shared Outlook in Milesian Natural Philosophy

2. Celestial and terrestrial phenomena operate on the same principles.
   1. stark contrast to religious philosophy stating celestial bodies were gods
   2. **Thales: "all things are full of gods" (11A22)**
   3. Anaximenes: "air is a god"
   4. Anaximander: "[the *apeiron*] ... is the divine. For it is deathless, and indestructible" (12A15)
   5. these philosophers do not abandon divinity in their language altogether, but pair the fundamental things of nature with gods

### Revisionist Theology

- common theme: a critique of predominant theology
- Xenophenes: we should be skeptical of any anthropomorphic conception

## Part 1, Lecture 7: Heraclitus on LOGOS

- the one book he wrote was widely quoted in antiquity
  - it is about **Logos**
- Logos has a range of meaning
- Heraclitus: Logos is everything that comes to be, even if people fail to understand it
  - **the unity of opposites**
  - he castigates Hesiod: "a man who could not recognize day and night: for they are one." (B57)
  - there is an underlying order that "sleepers" fail to see, given the multiplicity they do see
  - **the world is ultimately understandable**

## Part 1, Lecture 8: Heraclitus on Change

- "Changing, it rests." (B84a)
  - Heraclitus invokes the **unity of opposites.**
  - a "posset" is something that requires constant change
- "all things happen in accordance with strife" (B80)
- all the pre-socratic philosophers believe that **Change is a constant**
-
