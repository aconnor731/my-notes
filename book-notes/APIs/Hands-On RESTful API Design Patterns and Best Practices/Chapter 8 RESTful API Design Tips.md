# Chapter 8: RESTful API Design Tips

- enterprise-scale applications are being built as a collection of polyglot microservices
- business-critical applications are being designed, developed, and deployed as a set of independent, yet interactive, microservices
- REST APIs also have had tremendous success for services and applications
  - web, cloud, mobile, and IoT applications are being built with REST APIs
- **Because of its simplicity and lightweight nature, the REST paradigm has captured both minds and market share in large quantities**
- Every worthwhile microservice, application, and platform is being frontended with a REST interface.
- topics this chapter will discuss with regards to design patterns for building REST APIs:
  - Articulating the importance of APIs
  - Accentuating API design patterns and best practices
  - Enumerating API security guidelines
  - Explaining the various tools and platforms associated with API design, development, integration, security, and management
  - Tending toward the API-driven digital world

### Beginning with APIs

- APIs have gained so much popularity because they expose any application or service to the outside world to find and use its unique business and technical competencies
- to integrate all these different services, middleware solutions are being implemented like: enterprise application hubs, enterprise service buses, message brokers and queues, API gateways and management suites, and service meshes
- APIs are used for every device to expose them as a service to the outside world
- an API is a kind of messenger that receives and processes requests and ensures it runs enterprise systems successfully.
- For an integrated world, setting up, composing, securing, controlling, and enhancing APIs becomes paramount for global enterprises in showcasing their distinct capabilities to their customers, partners, and employees.

### Learning about application programming interfaces

- according to experts, an API is a set of rules and tools for initiating and governing how business workloads interact
- if applications were vehicles on the road, APIs would be the traffic rules
- if applications were food items, APIs would be recipes
- forming appropriate rules for the intended success of the APIs is vital
- application integration becomes simpler with APIs
- APIs have emerged as the standard for process integration

### APIs have become indispensable

Some of the different application architectures:

- **service-oriented architecture (SOA)**
- **event-driven architecture (EDA)**
- **resource-oriented architecture (ROA)**

Containers have become the default runtime for services.

**Due to the popularity of container-orchestration platforms, creating container clusters and using them to run software applications and services has become the most prominent way to develop, deploy, and manage software.**

Each microservice has:

- its own data store
- an API for each database

### Learning about the major types of APIs

There are a few API types:

- **Remote procedure call (RPC)**
  - enables applications to call one or more functions in other applications remotely
  - XML and JSON are the content types
- **SOAP**:
  - not really popular due to complexity and difficulty to implement
- **RESTful**:
  - every service, application, platform, middleware, and database is exposing this

### Describing API platforms

### Creating API development platforms

Building fresh APIs from scratch is time-consuming and error-prone.

They also have to go through several iterations in order to be considered stable and mature.

High-end API design can speed this up however.

API platforms enhance the **return on investment (RoI)** by leveraging existing investments.

Automated solutions exist and can accelerate the REST API design, development, documentation, and testing.

**RestCase**:

- cloud-based API development platform
- allows collaborative creation of REST APIs.
- automatically generates documentation, tests, and mocks

**Developers' productivity goes up significantly when they are being empowered through an API-development platform.**

- time and cost decreases

### API-integration platforms

For simplifying API integration, the most competent solution is API integration platforms.

It's estimated most applications will live in the cloud.

Popular enterprise-grade applications:

- **enterprise resource planning (ERP)**
- **supply chain management (SCM)**
- knowledge and content management
- HR
- finance
- facility management
- asset management

**To gain best-in-class applications, the role of API integration platforms is simply awe-inspiring.**

### Legacy integration

No one can dispute that the mainframe computer gives the highest performance.

Enterprises are still pretty slow to modernize legacy investments.

This encourages an integration pipeline between modern and legacy applications.

The API-integration platform enables data integration: data can be extracted, transformed, and loaded into databases and warehouses associated with, and attached to, new applications.

**It's mandatory to get and use legacy data** to produce and sustain integrated systems.

API integration platforms help with the formation of composite applications.

**Every microservice exposes an API.** Thus API integration platforms are essential to having them work together.

API integration platforms ensure future proof enterprise integration.

### API management platforms

**Enterprises are predominantly transactional**.

API management platforms are needed to precisely manage APIs.

**API management**: generally, it is all about designing high-quality APIs, and then publishing and analyzing them in order to continuously track their usage.

Primary purposes of an API-managment solution:

- **API design**
- **API gateway**
- **API store**
  - centralized storage so internal and external users can leverage them
- **API analytics**

**APIs have to be artistically architected.**

- have to be long-lasting
