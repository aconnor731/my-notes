The priest prays to Apollo and Apollo answers him by striking down many Achaeans for 9 days.

On the 10th day, Achilles asks the best seer, Calchas, to interpret what is happening.

Achilles argues with Agememnon to release the girl to him, but he is too headstrong. Achilles becomes enraged and threatens to desert.

Athena appears and speaks only to Achilles and persuades him not to take arms against Agememnon.

Atreus is the father of Agamemnon and Menelaus.

Nestor, King of Pylos.

Achilles is still enraged with Agamemnon and hurls violent words at him.

King Nestor begins to conciliate between the two.

Thetis, the immortal goddess and mother to Achilles

Peleus, the hero and father of Achilles.

Achilles persuades his mother to plead with Zeus to strike down the Achaean ships due to Agamemnon's insolence.

Hera charges Zeus that he always go to battle for the Trojans.

Thetis' plea to Zeus is granted by Zeus.

Hera argues with Zeus about assenting to Thetis' plea, and Zeus warns her to obey him else he use force on her.

Hera's son, Hephaestus, pleads to Hera to resolve her issues with Zeus.

## Book 2: The Great Gathering of Armies

Zeus ponders how to exalt Achilles to fulfill the promise he made to Thetis. He decides to send a false hope to Agamemnon through a Dream to immediately proceed to sack Troy.

King Agamemnon led by far the largest army.

Odysseus was considered a mastermind of battle of the same caliber as Zeus.

King Agamemnon took Achilles' girl, Briseis, as a display of power and arrogance. Achilles lay near the ships, his heart in agony for his loss of Briseis, while his soldiers sported along the surf, marking time, hurling the discus, throwing spears and testing bows.

Hector, King Priam of Troy's son, commanded by far the greatest, bravest army.

## Book 3: Helen Reviews the Champions

Odysseus, son of Laertes, Son of Pain, the man of twists and turns.

Since Aphrodite promised Paris Helen, she must defend Paris and ensure Helen goes with him.

Aphrodite takes and hides Paris as it appears he would lose the match with Menelaus and die.

Paris believes Athena is helping Menelaus.

Paris disappears and the book ends with the Achaeans searching for him, demanding Helen and their promised prizes as Paris has forfeit the match.

## Book 4: The Truce Erupts in War

Hera and Athena defend Menelaus while Aphrodite defends Paris.

They plot on how to bring the destruction of Troy to reality, while Zeus is angry with Hera as Troy has always worshiped Zeus.

Zeus commands Athena to break the truce between the Achaeans and the Trojans after listening to Hera.

Athena fires the fool's heart, Lycaon, the great archer, to fire an arrow into Menelaus.

Athena deflects the arrow to just graze Menelaus' skin, inflicting a non-mortal wound.

## Book 5: Diomedes Fights the Gods

The book begins outlining all of the men killed by the Achaeans.

Tydeus' son, Diomedes, is shot in the shoulder by an arrow from Lycaon's son, Pandarus, not a mortal wound.

Diomedes prays to Athena to give him strength to defeat Pandarus. Athena answers and gives him strength like his father and also the ability to discern a deathless god from a mortal man on the battle field. She tells him not to engage with a deathless god as Aphrodite would surely cut him down.

Pandarus believes Diomedes does not fight alone but has a god with him at his side.

Diomedes spears Pandarus through the face and cripples Aeneas with a boulder, crushing and breaking tendons and bones in his leg.

Diomedes pierces Aphrodite's wrist, and since she is a deathless god, she is also bloodless. Only ichor, the watery like substance from a wound, flowed from her wound.

Apollo brings Aphrodite from battle to Ares, where she asks him to get her to Olympus due to her injuries. Iris, takes her to Olympus and to Aphrodite's mother, Dione, the light and loveliest of immortals.

Dione tells Aphrodite of the pain other deathless gods had to endure before wiping away the ichor from Aphrodite's arm, healing her at once, ebbing her stark pain away.

After Athena mocks Aphrodite to Zeus for being injured, Zeus commands Aphrodite to leave the fighting to Athena and blazing Ares, and to see to the works of marriage, the slow fires of longing.

Diomedes then charges Apollo who was protecting Aeneas three times. On the fourth time, Apollo urges Diomedes to shrink back, for he cannot defeat a deathless god. Diomedes does shrink back and Apollo takes Aeneas to the sacred heights of Pergamus.

Apollo then asks murderous Ares to do something about Diomedes for injuring his sister, Aphrodite.

Ares rouses the spirit of the Trojans to fight for their wounded comrade, Aeneas.

Apollo then releases Aeneas, fully healed with great spirit, back to the battle, inspiring his men to see him alive and unharmed.

The Trojans bear down on two Aeantes, Tydides (Diomedes I think?) and Odysseus, who stood their ground like heavy thunderheads stacked up on the towering mountaintops by Cronus' son.

Diomedes notices Ares alongside Hector and tells his men to give ground, as there is no use trying to fight the gods in force.

As Hera, daughter of giant Cronus, notices Ares racking the Achaeans, she rouses Athena to fight back Ares.

Hera asks Zeus if she may fight Ares and Zeus commands her to unleash Athena against him, saying she is his match, a marvel at bringing Ares down in pain.

Athena fights alongside Diomedes and plunges a spear into Ares.

Ares then flies to Olympus to see Zeus where he complains that he never refuses Athena and her wishes.

Zeus then says no more to Ares, saying he has his mother Hera's uncontrollable rage. He says Hera is responsible for Ares suffering this. 

Ares is the child of Zeus and Hera.

The book finishes with Ares being healed by the Healer, and Athena and Hera returning to Olympus after stopping the murderous Ares from cutting men to pieces.
